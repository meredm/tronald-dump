Henry McMaster Lt. Governor of South Carolina who endorsed me beat failed CNN announcer Bakari Sellers so badly. Funny!

Jeff Zucker failed NBC and he is now failing CNN.

CNN is unwatchable. Their news on me is fiction. They are a disgrace to the broadcasting industry and an arm of the Clinton campaign.

The documentary of me that CNN just aired is a total waste of time. I don't even know many of the people who spoke about me. A joke!

Final poll results from NBC on last nights Commander-in-Chief Forum. Thank you! #ImWithYou #MAGA 

It wasn't Matt Lauer that hurt Hillary last night. It was her very dumb answer about emails & the veteran who said she should be in jail.#AmericaFirst #ImWithYou

With Luis Mexico and the United States would have made wonderful deals together - where both Mexico and the US would have benefitted.

Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is highly respected by President Pe√±a Nieto.

Hillary Clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past. She is totally confused. Unfit to serve as #POTUS.

Hillary just gave a disastrous news conference on the tarmac to make up for poor performance last night. She's being decimated by the media!

Last nights winner was clear & it will be proven time & time again - lets #MAGA!! Lets WIN!! #TrumpTrain

A rough night for Hillary Clinton. A rough night for Hillary Clinton.

A rough night for Hillary Clinton.

Wow the reviews are in - THANK YOU!

Thank you to @foxandfriends for the nice reviews of last night.

Thank you America - great #CommanderInChiefForum polls!

Thank you to our fantastic veterans. The reviews and polls from almost everyone of my Commander-in-Chief presentation were great. Nice! A rough night for Hillary Clinton.

Thank you Peter - if elected I will think big for our country & never let the American people down! #AmericaFirst

Mainstream media never covered Hillarys massive hacking or coughing attack yet it is #1 trending. Whats up?

Message for undecided voters: Please wake up and vote DonaldTrump now! Trump/Pence very important save our America before too late!

Thank you! #AmericaFirst 

As a tribute to the late great Phyllis Schlafly I hope everybody can go out and get her latest book THE CONSERVATIVE CASE FOR TRUMP.

China wouldn't provide a red carpet stairway from Air Force One and then Philippines President calls Obama "the son of a whore." Terrible!

The truly great Phyllis Schlafly who honored me with her strong endorsement for president has passed away at 92. She was very special!

Thank you Ohio! #AmericaFirst

Can you believe that the Chinese would not give Obama the proper stairway to get off his plane - fight on tarmac! 

President Obama & Putin fail to reach deal on Syria - so what else is new? Obama is not a natural deal maker. Only makes bad deals!

We need to show Americans that Hillary will KILL our Country !! Vote for Trump !!

It defies belief the Web of Lies Hillary is spinning! One excuse after another. Then it's this then it's that.

Lyin' Hillary Clinton told the FBI that she did not know the "C" markings on documents stood for CLASSIFIED. How can this be happening?

To the African-American community: The Democrats have failed you for fifty years high crime poor schools no jobs. I will fix it VOTE "T

The polls are close so Crooked Hillary is getting out of bed and will campaign tomorrow.Why did she hammer 13 devices and acid-wash e-mails?

The Great State of Arizona where I just had a massive rally (amazing people) has a very weak and ineffective Senator Jeff Flake. Sad!

The Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders not weak people such as @JeffFlake if it is going to stop illegal immigration.

Doesn't fit the media narrative - so they wont share what I did for Jesse Jackson in 1999 - so I will!

CNN is so biased. Never ever watch them. Trump 2016!!

Crooked Hillary's V.P. pick said this morning that I was not aware that Russia took over Crimea. A total lie - and taken over during O term!

Wow the failing New York Times has not reported properly on Crooked's FBI release. They are at the back of the pack - no longer a credible source

CNN is so disgusting in their bias but they are having a hard time promoting Crooked Hillary in light of the new e-mail scandals.

Great visit to Detroit church fantastic reception and all @CNN talks about is a small protest outside. Inside a large and wonderful crowd!

Now that African-Americans are seeing what a bad job Hillary type policy and management has done to the inner-cities they want TRUMP!

Crooked Hillary's brainpower is highly overrated.Probably why her decision making is so bad or as stated by Bernie S she has BAD JUDGEMENT

Does anyone know that Crooked Hillary who tried so hard was unable to pass the Bar Exams in Washington D.C. She was forced to go elsewhere

I know of NO ONE voting for Crooked Hillary! Her rallies are held in theatre & she still has room.

I will be making a major speech on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION on Wednesday in the GREAT State of Arizona. Big crowds looking for a larger venue.

How quickly people forget that Crooked Hillary called African-American youth "SUPER PREDATORS" - Has she apologized?

I am very proud to have brought the subject of illegal immigration back into the discussion. Such a big problem for our country-I will solve

Wonderful Pastor Mark Burns was attacked viciously and unfairly on MSNBC by crazy morning mika on low ratings Morning Joe. Apologize!

What do African-Americans and Hispanics have to lose by going with me. Look at the poverty crime and educational statistics. I will fix it!

Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to solve the problems of poverty education and safety within the African-American & Hispanic communities.

CLINTON CORRUPTION AND HER SABOTAGE OF THE INNER CITIES.  Full speech transcript: 

Hillary Clinton only knows how to make a speech when it is a hit on me. No policy and always very short (stamina). Media gives her a pass!

HRC is using the oldest play in the Dem playbook- when their policies fail they are left w/this one tired argument! 

Hillary Clinton is using race-baiting to try to get African-American voters- but they know she is all talk and NO ACTION!

Hillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society. She should be ashamed of herself!

Just watched recap of #CrookedHillary's speech. Very short and lies. She is the only one fear-mongering!

So many in the African-American community are doing so badly poverty and crime way up employment and jobs way down: I will fix it promise

Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad!

Stay on message" is the chant. I always do - trade jobs military vets 2nd A repeal Ocare borders etc - but media misrepresents!

I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!

It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!

I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!

My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.

If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say I would be beating Hillary by 20%

The failing New York Times which never spoke to me keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False I am who I am-never said

The failing New York Times talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary!

You are a man for the people because you know what it is like to be among the people #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #USA Loves U" Thanks

We're all enjoying you as well Mr. T.! You've inspired Hope and a Positive Spirit throughout America! God bless you!" Nice

Yes you are my hero I admire you for laying down your glorious luxurious life to get beat up for America!!!

We now have confirmation as to one reason Crooked H wanted to be sure that nobody saw her e-mails - PAY-FOR-PLAY. How can she run for Pres.

I love watching these poor pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out. They can't!

They can't! They can't!

They can't!

They can't!

A massive tax increase will be necessary to fund Crooked Hillary Clinton's agenda. What a terrible (and boring) rollout that was yesterday!

hank you for coming to Pennsylvania today.

Ratings challenged CNN reports so seriously that I call President Obama (and Clinton) "the founder" of ISIS & MVP. THEY DON'T GET SARCASM?

Now cut off my mic! Bongino refuses to be bullied by Don Lemon over Trump 2nd Amendment  HEATED! 

Media desperate to distract from Clinton's anti-2A stance. I said pro-2A citizens must organize and get out vote to save our Constitution!

When is the media going to talk about Hillary's policies that have gotten people killed like Libya open borders and maybe her emails?

Anybody whose mind "SHORT CIRCUITS" is not fit to be our president! Look up the word "BRAINWASHED.

Crooked Hillary said loudly and for the world to see that she "SHORT CIRCUITED" when answering a question on her e-mails. Very dangerous!

Hillary Clinton is being badly criticized for her poor performance in answering questions. Let us all see what happens!

Hillary Clinton has bad judgment and is unfit to serve as President. 

The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva Switzerland not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!

President Obama refuses to answer question about Iran terror funding.  I won't dodge questions as your President. 

Obama's disastrous judgment gave us ISIS rise of Iran and the worst economic numbers since the Great Depression!

President Obama should ask the DNC about how they rigged the election against Bernie.

See you tomorrow w/ Gov. Mike Pence Iowa & Wisconsin!  3pm-

Our incompetent Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was the one who started talks to give 400 million dollars in cash to Iran. Scandal!

There is great unity in my campaign perhaps greater than ever before. I want to thank everyone for your tremendous support. Beat Crooked H!

STATEMENT IN RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FAILED LEADERSHIP: 

Thank you Virginia! #ImWithYou 

The Washington Post calls out #CrookedHillary for what she REALLY is. A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR! Watch that nose grow! 

Great afternoon in Ohio & a great evening in Pennsylvania - departing now. See you tomorrow Virginia! 

Just leaving Mechanicsburg PA. Incredible crowd-- so enthusiastic! Will be back soon. #MAGA 

Vast numbers of manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania have moved to Mexico and other countries. That will end when I win!

Thanks to @pnehlen for your kind words very much appreciated.

Join me in Florida on Wednesday! Daytona & Jacksonville.

During the GOP convention CNN cut away from the victims of illegal immigrant violence. They dont want them heard. 

When will CNN do a segment on Hillarys plan to increase Syrian refugees 550% and how much it will cost?

Hillary Clinton raked in money from regimes that horribly oppress women and gays & refuses to speak out against Radical Islam.

Hillary whose decisions have led to the deaths of many accepted $ from a business linked to ISIS. Silence at CNN. 

Crooked Hillary Clinton is 100% owned by her donors. #ImWithYou #MAGA 

Thank you Columbus Ohio! I will be back soon. #ImWithYou #MAGA 

Thank you Oklahoma & Virginia!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #ImWithYou 

People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillary....that's really saying something!

The people who support Hillary sit behind CNN anchor chairs or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life.

Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary?

When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary's pay-for-play at State Department?

CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime failing schools and vanishing jobs.

CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton.

Join Governor Mike Pence in Reno Nevada- tonight at 7pm! Tickets available at: 

#CrookedHillary  

So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine they have already taken Crimea and continue to push. That's what I said!

When I said in an interview that Putin is "not going into Ukraine you can mark it down I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea!

This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!

Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice!

Wow, it is unbelievable how distorted, one-sided and biased the media is against us. The failing New York Times is a joke. CNN is laughable!

Without absolutely OWNING the liberal media, HillaryClinton wouldn't stand a chance. #VoterFraud and mainstream media her only hope.

The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H?

I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!

Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our ""leaders"" to eradicate it!

Nielson Media Research final numbers on ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: TRUMP  32.2 MILLION.  CLINTON 27.8 MILLION.  Thank you!

Thank you to all of the television viewers that made my speech at the Republican National Convention #1 over Crooked Hillary and DEMS.

Can you imagine if I had the small crowds that Hillary is drawing today in Pennsylvania. It would be a major media event! CNN FoxNews

NATO commander agrees members should pay up!

NATO commander agrees members should pay up!

NATO commander agrees members should pay up!

Wow, NATO's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must PAY THEIR BILLS. This is a general I will like!

The ""Rust Belt"" was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico. END!

Crooked's stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 - with Bill, VP

#CrookedHillary = Obama's third term, which would be terrible news for our economic growth - seen below. 

Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?

I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!

Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two ""Big Thursdays"" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings

#CrookedHillary 

Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster!

Violent crime is rising across the United States, yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities.

Just got back from Colorado. The love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible. Big crowds!

While I am in OH & PA - you can also join Mike Pence in Nevada on Mon!  
 
American homeownership rate in Q2 2016 was 62.9% - lowest rate in 51yrs. WE will bring back the  'American Dream!' 

'American Dream!'

We are suffering through the worst long-term unemployment in the last 70 years. I want change - Crooked Hillary Clinton does not.

Hillary can never win over Bernie supporters. Her foreign wars,  NAFTA/TPP support & Wall Street ties are driving away millions of votes.

Colorado was amazing yesterday! So much support. Our tax, trade and energy reforms will bring great jobs to Colorado and the whole country.

ONLY TRUMP CAN UNITE AMERICA AND FIX OBAMA'S MISTAKES!!! 

ONLY TRUMP CAN UNITE AMERICA AND FIX OBAMA'S MISTAKES!!!

Thank you Denver, Colorado!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 

As usual, Hillary & the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games. Same as last time w/ Bernie. Unacceptable!

#CrookedHillary Job Application 

Hillary Clinton should not be given national security briefings in that she is a lose cannon with extraordinarily bad judgement & insticts.

Thank you to the amazing law enforcement officers in Colorado! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #LESM 

Only a Reagan or a Trump-like figure in the White House will achieve this goal."" 

Even Bill is tired of the lies, SAD! 
 
What Bernie Sanders really thinks of Crooked Hillary Clinton. 

I am watching Crooked Hillary speak. Same old stuff, our country needs change!

Wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary. She sold them out, V.P. pick!

In Hillary Clinton's America - things get worse. #TrumpPence16 

The dishonest media didn't mention that Bernie Sanders was very angry looking during Crooked's speech. He wishes he didn't make that deal!

Crooked Hillary said that I ""couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign."" Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her!

If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York, he wouldn't get 10% of the vote - they would run him out of town!  #NeverHillary

Little"" Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster!

General John Allen, who I never met but spoke against me last night, failed badly in his fight against ISIS. His record = BAD  #NeverHillary

Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech. Many of her statements were lies and fabrications!

Mike Pence!!

Mike Pence!!

Mike Pence!!

Ann Coulter is very smart!

Ann Coulter is very smart!

Ann Coulter is very smart!

Two policemen just shot in San Diego, one dead. It is only getting worse. People want LAW AND ORDER!

Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and ""forgot"" to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream!

The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. CNN and the little watched Morning Joe = SAD!

SAD!

SAD!

SAD!

SAD!

SAD!

SAD!

SAD!

No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.

Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world.

Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety.

Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street!

Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.

Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.

Departing now - thank you Cedar Rapids, Iowa. This is a MOVEMENT! 

#CrookedHillary 

Dems warn not to underestimate Trump's potential win"" 

Great to be back in Iowa! TBT with Jerry Jr Falwell joining me in Davenport- this past winter. #MAGA 

Median household income is down for the middle class since Obama took office. It will only go further down under Clinton.

A vote for Clinton-Kaine is a vote for TPP, NAFTA, high taxes, radical regulation, and massive influx of refugees.

AMERICA'S FUTURE 

Bernie caved! 

Donald Trump Sees 17-Point Positive Swing in Two Weeks

Trump makes a funny, obvious joke about Russia going after Hillary's emails & U.S. media goes insane with fury.

Obama Refers to Himself 119 Times During Hillary Nominating Speech... 

President Obama spoke last night about a world that doesnt exist. 70% of the people think our country is going in the wrong direction. #DNC

My message is resonating with the PEOPLE

Barack is offended that I will demand that #NATO allies pay their fair share. #DemsInPhilly

Barack is offended that I will demand that #NATO allies pay their fair share. #DemsInPhilly

Our country does not feel 'great already' to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty, violence and despair.

Shooting deaths of police officers up 78% this year. We must restore law and order and protect our great law enforcement officers!

#CrookedHillary 

Thank you to our amazing law enforcement officers! #MAGA 

Trump right: Illegal families crossing border set to double, 51,152 so far"" 

Great new poll - thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton's 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI!

Join our next Vice President, Mike Pence in Wisconsin tonight & Michigan Thursday! 

Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic

Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to ""carpet bomb"" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz!

Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!

Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!

The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!

Funny how the failing New York Times is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said ""Trump is a genius."" America 1st!

As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.

Just like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP.  

Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep?

I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!

No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated!

You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is, and neither does ISIS (a good thing). Please get your facts straight - thanks. 

For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia.

In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy!

Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here.

Bernie's exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed!

The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!

Thank you New Hampshire!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Pocahontas bombed last night! Sad to watch.

Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great

Funny, if you listen to Fox News, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference

Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.

Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!

Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.

If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.

I was at Fox News and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!

Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke!

While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.

Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War.

Thank you OHIO! #TrumpPence16 

Thank you Roanoke, Virginia- be back soon! #TrumpPence16

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain  

Great POLL numbers are coming out all over. People don't want another four years of Obama, and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGA

The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!

Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!

Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!

Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her ""servant"" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie.

If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.

Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!

How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!

The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me

Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing!

The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!

The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!

The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!

Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!

Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out

If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild

The CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!

I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!

Today proves what I have always known, that Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz

Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!

There is no longer a Bernie Sanders ""political revolution."" He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!

An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.

Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!

Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!

Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT

The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!

Kaine supported the stupidest deal in the history of deals 

Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart!

The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud!

Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!

I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!

Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!

Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!

Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.

Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED

Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!

Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!

The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?

General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS! #MakeAmericaSafeAgain

I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.

Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?

Another attack, this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich.

One of the best produced, including the incredible stage & set, in the history of conventions. Great unity! Big T.V. ratings!

Thank you Cleveland. We love you and will be back many times!

What a great four days in Cleveland. So proud of the great job done by the RNC and all. The police and Secret Service were fantastic!

MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN! #RNCinCLE 

FORMAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE NOMINATION! #TrumpPence16 

You can watch 360 video live from the podium! 

This is a MOVEMENT! #RNCinCLE 

Thank you Donald J Trump Jr. Proud of you! 

Great job Ivanka Trump! #RNCinCLE 

Other than a small group of people who have suffered massive and embarrassing losses, the party is VERY united. Great love in the arena!

Ted Cruz talks about the Constitution but doesn't say that if the Dems win the Presidency, the new JUSTICES appointed will destroy us all!

I am soooo proud of my children, Don, Eric and Tiffany - their speeches, under enormous pressure, were incredible. Ivanka intros me tonight!

Great job Eric Trump! Proud of you! #AmericaFirst #RNCinCLE 

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Arena was packed, totally electric!

Mike Pence was fantastic tonight. Will be a great V.P.

Our next Vice President of the United States of America, Gov. Mike Pence!

Wow, Ted Cruz got booed off the stage, didn't honor the pledge! I saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway. No big deal!

Great job Eric Trump! Proud of you!  #AmericaFirst #RNCinCLE 

Thank you Scott Walker! #AmericaFirst  #RNCinCLE 

Thank you to Governor Scott Walker for such warm support. Great speech!

Thank you Ingraham!

Watching the #GOPConvention #AmericaFirst #RNCinCLE

John Kasich was never asked by me to be V.P. Just arrived in Cleveland - will be a great two days!

The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails.

Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!

In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs!

Bill Hemmer of FoxNews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. More than in past years.

Congratulations to my children, Don and Tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night. I am very proud of you!

Such a great honor to be the Republican Nominee for President of the United States. I will work hard and never let you down! AMERICA FIRST!

The ROLL CALL is beginning at the Republican National Convention. Very exciting!

Democrats are coming to TRUMP. I used to be proud of the dem party. No more It is crooked and not for the people.

It was truly an honor to introduce my wife, Melania. Her speech and demeanor were absolutely incredible. Very proud! #GOPConvention

Will be on Oreilly Factor tonight at 8:30pm @FoxNews- prior to Melania's speech at the #GOPConvention. Tune in- she will do great!  

Networks other than low ratings @CNN have been very fair and exciting!

CNN is the worst.T hey go to their dumb, one-sided panels when a podium speaker is for Trump! VAST MAJORITY want: Make America Great Again!

Looking forward to being at the convention tonight to watch all of the wonderful speakers including my wife Melania. Place looks beautiful!

President Obama just had a news conference but he doesn't have a clue. Our country is a divided crime scene and it will only get worse!

Our country is totally divided and our enemies are watching. We are not looking good we are not looking smart we are not looking tough!

Bad times for divided USA!

Bad times for divided USA!

Bad times for divided USA!

Bad times for divided USA!

We are TRYING to fight ISIS and now our own people are killing our police. Our country is divided and out of control. The world is watching

We grieve for the officers killed in Baton Rouge today. How many law enforcement and people have to... 

The ratings at Fox News blow away the ratings of CNN - not even close. That's because CNN is the Clinton News Network and people don't like

Fox News is much better and far more truthful than CNN which is all negative. Guests are stacked for Crooked Hillary! I don't watch.

If Goofy Elizabeth Warren a very weak Senator didn't lie about her heritage (being Native American) she would be nothing today. Pick her H

I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas as her V.P. Then we can litigate her fraud!

It doesn't matter that Crooked Hillary has experience look at all of the bad decisions she has made. Bernie said she has bad judgement!

As the days and weeks go by  we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in - Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions!

We are going to have a great time in Cleveland. Will lead to special results for our country. We will Make America Great Again!

Goofy Elizabeth Warren who may be the least productive Senator in the U.S. Senate must prove she is not a fraud. Without the con it's over

Thank you to Jack Morgan Tamara Neo Cheryl Ann Kraft and all of my friends and supporters in Virginia. GREAT JOB!

Great news! We've been nominated for Ireland's Best Golf Hotel 2016. We would appreciate your vote! 

Thank you to Chris Cox and Bikers for Trump - Your support has been amazing. I will never forget. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Thank you! #TrumpPence16 

Crooked Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for by Wall Street lobbyists and special interests. She will sell our country down the tubes!

Very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes Crooked Hillary Clinton can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money!

Crooked Hillary who embarrassed herself and the country with her e-mail lies has been a DISASTER on foreign policy. Look what's happening!

Crooked Hillary is spending big Wall Street money on ads saying I don't have foreign policy experience yet look what her policies have done

Look forward to introducing Governor Mike Pence (who has done a spectacular job in the great State of Indiana). My first choice from start!

Look forward to Governor Mike Pence V.P. introduction tomorrow in New York City.

I am pleased to announce that I have chosen Governor Mike Pence as my Vice Presidential running mate. News conference tomorrow at 11:00 A.M.

Four more years of weakness with a Crooked Hillary Administration is not acceptable. Look what has happened to the world with O & Hillary!

#NeverTrump is never more. They were crushed last night in Cleveland at Rules Committee by a vote of 87-12. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

My prayers and condolences to the victims and families of the terrible tragedy in Nice France. We are with you in every way!

In light of the horrible attack in Nice France I have postponed tomorrow's news conference concerning my Vice Presidential announcement.

Another horrific attack this time in Nice France. Many dead and injured. When will we learn? It is only getting worse.

I employ many people in the State of Virginia - JOBS JOBS JOBS! Crooked Hillary will sell us out just like her husband did with NAFTA.

Another new poll. Thank you for your support! Join the MOVEMENT today!  #ImWithYou 

Great new poll- thank you America! #Trump2016 #ImWithYou 

I will be making the announcement of my Vice Presidential pick on Friday at 11am in Manhattan. Details to follow.

If I win the Presidency we will swamp Justice Ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions!

Even the NYTimes and Washington Post Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach. What was she thinking?

Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge!

On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party. I am spending a lot myself and also helping others.

Voters understand that Crooked Hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity.

Despite spending $500k a day on TV ads alone #CrookedHillary falls flat in nationwide Quinnipiac Poll. Having ZERO impact. Sad!!

Despite spending $500k a day on TV ads alone #CrookedHillary falls flat in nationwide Quinnipiac Poll. Having ZERO impact. Sad!!

Sad!!

Sad!!

Lyin' Crooked Hillary's email stories all have one thing in common. 

Is President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves? Think about it and let me know!

The Republican platform is most  pro-Israel of all time!

New GOP platform now includes language that supports the border wall. We will build the wall and MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!

#CrookedHillary is outspending me by a combined 31 to 1 in Florida Ohio & Pennsylvania. I haven't started yet! 

Thank you Florida Ohio and Pennsylvania! #CrookedHillary is not qualified. 

Justice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot - resign! 

The American people agree. No free pass for #CrookedHillary! 

To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals & global special interests we welcome you with open arms. People first.

Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton.

Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.

#CrookedHillary is not qualified! 

I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. They are not happy that he is selling out!

Bernie Sanders who has lost most of his leverage has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry!

This election is a choice between law order & safety - or chaos crime & violence. I will make America safe again for everyone. #ImWithYou

For too many years our inner cities have been left behind. I am going to deliver jobs safety and protection for those in need.

Crime is out of control and rapidly getting worse. Look what is going on in Chicago and our inner cities. Not good!

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #ImWithYou 

Senior United States District Judge Robert E. Payne today ruled in favor of Trump campaign delegates who had argued..

Great poll- Florida! Thank you! 

Thoughts and prayers with the victims and their families- along with everyone at the Berrien County Courthouse in St. Joseph Michigan.

Join me in Westfield Indiana- tomorrow night at 7:30pm! #Trump2016  Tickets: 

I heard that the underachieving John King of CNN on Inside Politics was one hour of lies. Happily few people are watching - dead network!

The media is so dishonest. If I make a statement they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish.They think the public is stupid!

President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. He is living in a world of the make believe!

Look what is happening to our country under the WEAK leadership of Obama and people like Crooked Hillary Clinton. We are a divided nation!

New poll - thank you! #Trump2016 

Way to go Serena Williams  - you are a true champion. Proud of you!

MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN! 

Isn't it sad that on a day of national tragedy Hillary Clinton is answering softball questions about her email lies on CNN?

Due to the horrific events taking place in our country I have decided to postpone my speech on economic opportunity- today in Miami.

Last night's horrific execution-style shootings of 12 Dallas law enforcement officers...

Prayers and condolences to all of the families who are so thoroughly devastated by the horrors we are all watching take place in our country

After today Crooked Hillary can officially be called Lyin' Crooked Hillary.

Just leaving D.C. Had great meetings with Republicans in the House and Senate. Very interesting day! These are people who love our country!

Great being in Cincinnati Ohio last night- thank you! Off to Washington D.C. now. #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst 

Where is the outrage for this Disney book? Is this the 'Star of David' also?  Dishonest media! #Frozen 

To all of my twitter followers please contribute whatever you can to the campaign. We must beat Crooked Hillary. 

Convention speaker schedule to be released tomorrow. Let today be devoted to Crooked Hillary and the rigged system under which we live.

I have over seven million hits on social media re Crooked Hillary Clinton. Check it out Sleepy Eyes 

Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd a man with so little touch for politics is at it again. He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C.

Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd a man with so little touch for politics is at it again. He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C.

Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City.

Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center Airport - and destroyed City

I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes now many bankruptcies.

Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch her time will come!

The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges but...

Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest incompetent and of very bad judgement.

Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive highly classified information." Not fit!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT!

I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with "murder." Come November 8 she's out!

Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win

FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem

The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual bad judgment.

It was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday. She has done a fantastic job for the people of Iowa and U.S. Will see her again!

Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace!

Meet the Trumps! Hope you enjoy!

Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?

Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?

With Hillary and Obama the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is "guilty as hell" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33000 missing e-mails?

The only people who are not interested in being the V.P. pick are the people who have not been asked!

I look forward to meeting Joni Ernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!

I look forward to meeting Joni Ernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!

I look forward to meeting Joni Ernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!

Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday. Very impressed great people!

Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday. Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd the end result was solid!

Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff's Star or plain star!

Happy 4th of July! #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst 

Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change!

The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this!

In Bangladesh hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed!

I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!

The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting "go away no pictures.

Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about "grandkids" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?

THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!

THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!

THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!

On Saturday a great man Elie Wiesel passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!

Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged & corrupt!

Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.

Just watched meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd and the entire show is against me.The good news-the people get it!

It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said the system is totally rigged!

It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!


Reminder: last year Clinton pledged she had turned over all work-related email under penalty of perjury  

Thank you! #AmericaFirst 

If I become the next POTUS- they will not be ignoring!  

If I become the next POTUS- they will not be ignoring!  

Crooked Hillary -- Makes History!

The #2A to our Constitution is clear. The right of the people to keep & bear Arms shall not be infringed upon. 

#AmericaFirst #ImWithYou 

The speakers slots at the Republican Convention are totally filled with a long waiting list of those that want to speak - Wednesday release

Just read in the failing New York Times that I was not aware "the event had to be held in Cleveland" - a total lie. These people are sick!

When you can't say it - or see it -- you can't fix it. We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN! #ImWithYou #AmericaFirst 

These crimes won't be happening if I'm elected POTUS. Killer should have never been here. #AmericaFirst  

Yet another terrorist attack today in Israel -- a father shot at by a Palestinian terrorist was killed while: 

Horrible killing of a 13 year old American girl at her home in Israel by a Palestinian terrorist. We must get tough. 

Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton. The system is totally rigged. Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?

Bill Clinton's meeting was a total secret. Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter.

As Bernie Sanders said Hillary Clinton has bad judgement. Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary!

The reason I put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. $50 million loan. I have totally terminated the loan!

The very dishonest NBC News refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign. Done deal!

One of the reasons Hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldn't see how she got rich- selling out America.  

Why would college graduates want Crooked Hillary as their President? She will destroy them!  

The story with Hillary will never change. 

For reasons only they can explain the US Chamber wants to continue our bad trade deals rather than renegotiating and making them better.

Tremendous day in Massachusetts and Maine. Thank you to everyone for making it so special!

As of April this year Hillary had spent $2640000 on her campaign Mr.Trump $550000. Self Funding

ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will. Not capable!

ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will. Not capable!

ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will. Not capable!

Why would the USChamber be upset by the fact that I want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that I want penalties for cheaters?

The US CHAMBER must fight harder for the American worker. China and many others are taking advantage of U.S. with our terrible trade pacts

Iron Mike Tyson was not asked to speak at the Convention though I'm sure he would do a good job if he was. The media makes everything up!

This administration is incapable of keeping our country safe!

We must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the United States.

Yet another terrorist attack this time in Turkey. Will the world ever realize what is going on? So sad.

Hillary Clintons Presidency would be catastrophic for the future of our country. She is ill-fit with bad judgment.

Benghazi is just another Hillary Clinton failure. It just never seems to work the way it's supposed to with Clinton.

Check it out - 2nd video on Lying Crooked Hillary is now online! Watch it here:  

Cancel cable - sick of their bad coverage of you and the fawning over Clinton. Listened to your great speech on YouTube


Cancel cable - sick of their bad coverage of you and the fawning over Clinton. Listened to your great speech on YouTube

Ann Coulter also can't help but notice the stock market's reaction as I was speaking. #UPUPUP

Create jobs!

Maybe If corporations weren't overtaxed they would stay.

CNN is all negative when it comes to me. I don't watch it anymore.

The media is unrelenting. They will only go with and report a story in a negative light. I called Brexit (Hillary was wrong) watch November

Crooked Hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the U.S. Senate goofy Elizabeth Warren who lied on heritage.

Under a Trump presidency America will make brilliant new trade deals!

Hillary read "sigh" off the Teleprompter She's so fake she has to be told how to feel!

W know they're fake just like poles during primary. I'm sure I will crush #CrookedHillary in general

The "dirty" poll done by ABC is a disgrace. Even they admit that many more Democrats were polled. Other polls were good.

Crooked Hillary Attacks Foreign Government Donations - While Ignoring Her Own: 

Crooked Hillary Clinton got Brexit wrong. I said LEAVE will win. She has no sense of markets and such bad judgement. Only a question of time

Hillary Clinton is not a change agent just the same old status quo! She is spending a fortune I am spending very little. Close in polls!

People in our country want borders and without them the old line pols like Crooked Hillary will not win. It is time for CHANGE -- and JOBS!

Top 50 Facts About Crooked Hillary Clinton From Trump 'Stakes Of The Election' Address: 

The ABC poll sample is heavy on Democrats.  Very dishonest - why would they do that? Other polls good!

Crooked Hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at Turnberry. Shows me hitting shot but I never did = lie! Was there to support son

Clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on BREXIT with big dollar ads. Disgraceful!

Crooked Hillary Clinton who called BREXIT 100% wrong (along with Obama) is now spending Wall Street money on an ad on my correct call.

George Will one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago) has left the Republican Party.He's made many bad calls

Just landed in New York - a one night stay in Scotland. Turnberry came out magnificently. My son Eric did a great job - under budget!

Obama has blocked ICE officers and BP from doing their jobs. That ends when I am President!

I have never liked the media term 'mass deportation' -- but we must enforce the laws of the land!

We only want to admit those who love our people and support our values. #AmericaFirst

We must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place.

So funny Crooked Hillary called BREXIT so incorrectly and now she says that she is the one to deal with the U.K. All talk no action!

Thoughts and prayers are with everyone in West Virginia- dealing with the devastating floods. #ImWithYou

And we will get it back once we have President Trump! Can't wait!

What has happened in the UK in the last 12 hours is exactly what will happen in November..vote TRUMP 2016

Many people are equating BREXIT and what is going on in Great Britain with what is happening in the U.S. People want their country back!

The opening of Trump Turnberry in Scotland was a big success. Good timing I was here for BREXIT. Very exciting news conference today!

Crooked Hillary called it totally wrong on BREXIT - she went with Obama - and now she is saying we need her to lead. She would be a disaster

I want all Americans to succeed together. President Obama's illegal executive amnesty undermines job prospects for...

New Government data by the Center for Immigration Studies shows more than 3M new legal & illegal immigrants settled..

America is proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder w/a free & ind UK. We stand together as friends as allies & as a people w/a shared history.

Self-determination is the sacred right of all free people's and the people of the UK have exercised that right for all the world to see.

Getting ready to open the magnificent Turnberry in Scotland. What a great day especially when added to the brave & brilliant vote.

Statement Regarding British Referendum on E.U. Membership 

Just arrived in Scotland. Place is going wild over the vote. They took their country back just like we will take America back. No games!

Congratulations to my son Eric on the fantastic job he has done in rebuilding Turnberry and its great Ailsa Course. Always support kids!

Leaving now for a one night trip to Scotland in order to be at the Grand Opening of my great Turnberry Resort. Will be back on Sat. night!

Meet the amazing mother whose letter I read during my speech. She lost her son to policies supported by Clinton. 

Read my full statement here on the Supreme Court's executive amnesty decision #imwithyou  

Here is another CNN lie. The Clinton News Network is losing all credibility. Im not watching it much anymore.  

CNN which is totally biased in favor of Clinton should apologize. They knew they were wrong.  

Trump's speech today is the best persuasion I have ever seen. Game over. 

Our inner cities have been left behind. We will never have the resources to support our people if we have an open border.

On immigration Im consulting with our immigration officers & our wage-earners. Hillary Clinton is consulting with Wall Street.

Obama & Clinton should stop meeting with special interests & start meeting with the victims of illegal immigration.

Hillary Clintons open borders are tearing American families apart. I am going to make our country Safe Again for all Americans. #Imwithyou

SC has kept us safe from exec amnesty--for now. But Hillary has pledged to expand it taking jobs from Hispanic & African-American workers.

I was so impressed by my speech yesterday. He was the best I've ever seen him." 

Hillary Lies to Benghazi Families #CrookedHillary  

ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama."  --  Donald J. Trump

Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency."  --   Donald J. Trump

Thank you to Donald Rumsfeld for the endorsement. Very much appreciated. Clinton's conduct has been "disqualifying.

You have great children future presidents...and we all see were raised right and out there for their father." Thank you.

Hillary says things can't change. I say they have to change. It's a choice between Americanism and her corrupt globalism. #Imwithyou

Crooked Hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief! She will be a disaster for jobs and the economy!

I will be interviewed by Lou Dobbs

Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State. She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich! Corrupt dangerous dishonest.

If you want to know about Hillary Clinton's honesty & judgment ask the family of Ambassador Stevens.

Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays.

I am "the king of debt."That has been great for me as a businessman but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt will fix U.S.

Obama-Clinton inherited $10T in debt and turned it into nearly $20T.  They have bankrupted 

Hillary Clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans - and make everyone less safe.

How can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk?

Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as Secretary of State costing Americans millions of jobs.

Hillary says this election is about judgment.  She's right.  Her judgement has killed thousands unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy.

I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton.

Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our president-really bad judgement and a temperament according to new book which is a mess!

When I said that if within the Orlando club you had some people with guns I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees

We are so proud of you Dustin. Your reaction under pressure was amazing. First of many Majors. You are a true CHAMPION!

Yesterday's failing NYTimes fraudulently shows an empty room prior to my speech when in fact it was packed! 

How can the NY Times show an empty room hours before my speech even started when they knew it was going to be packed? So totally dishonest!

My Speech Is a Game Changer.

Thank you Dallas PD!

The speech today was Churchillian only better.  You can tell by the spluttering hysteria on TV.

Finally an accurate story from the Washington Post!   

Thank you Atlanta Georgia! Will be back soon! #AmericaFirst 

I will be meeting with the NRA who has endorsed me about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list or the no fly list to buy guns.

The press is so totally biased that we have no choice but to take our tough but fair and smart message directly to the people!

An: Media fell all over themselves criticizing what DonaldTrump "may have insinuated about POTUS." But he's right: 

HAPPY 241st BIRTHDAY to the @USArmy! THANK YOU! 

Thank you to the LGBT community! I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs.

AMERICA FIRST!

American must now get very tough very smart and very vigilant. We cannot admit people into our country without extraordinary screening.

Join me in Atlanta on Wednesday- at noon! #Trump2016 Tickets: 

Crooked Hillary says we must call on Saudi Arabia and other countries to stop funding hate. I am calling on- cont'd: 

Saudi Arabia and many of the countries that gave vast amounts of money to the Clinton Foundation- cont'd: 

I thought people werent celebrating? They were cheering all over even this savage from Orlando. I was right. 

In my speech on protecting America I spoke about a temporary ban which includes suspending immigration from nations tied to Islamic terror.

Based on the incredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting of the record setting Trump campaign we are hereby:  

I am no fan of President Obama but to show you how dishonest the phony Washington Post is: 

Anyone who plans to talk about Trump ever again has to see this speech.  Your opinion is irrelevant unless you listened

TERRORISM IMMIGRATION AND NATIONAL SECURITY SPEECH- TRANSCRIPT: 

I am watching FoxNews and how fairly they are treating me and my words and CNN and the total distortion of my words and what I am saying

I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror. Hillary just broke-said she would now use!

What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough

Please make us safe. We cannot have Hillary as president. We will be in so much trouble.

Reporting that Orlando killer shouted "Allah hu Akbar!" as he slaughtered clubgoers. 2nd man arrested in LA with rifles near Gay parade.

Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace!

Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism I don't want congrats I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!

Horrific incident in FL. Praying for all the victims & their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough smart & vigilant?

Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame!

Really bad shooting in Orlando. Police investigating possible terrorism. Many people dead and wounded.

Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas pretended to be a Native American in order to advance her career. Very racist!

Riley Rone was a great young man. We will miss him dearly. 

Thank you to our amazing law enforcement officers! #AmericaFirst 

Thank you Tampa Florida! #AmericaFirst #TrumpTrain 

Sad case- USATODAY did article saying I don't pay bills- false only don't pay when work is shoddy bad or not done! They should do same!

In Tampa Florida- thank you to all of our outstanding volunteers who want to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 

Don King and so many other African Americans who know me well and endorsed me would not have done so if they thought I was a racist!

Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist-but I am least racist person there is

Thank you FaithandFreedom Coalition! An honor joining you today- to discuss our shared values. #RTM2016 #Trump2016

Pocahontas is at it again! Goofy Elizabeth Warren one of the least productive U.S. Senators has a nasty mouth. Hope she is V.P. choice.

Trump's Historic 13 Million Primary Votes.

How long did it take your staff of 823 people to think that up--and where are your 33000 emails that you deleted? 

A message of condolences and support regarding the terrorist attacks in Tel Aviv:  

Obama just endorsed Crooked Hillary. He wants four more years of Obamabut nobody else does!

Crooked Hillary Clinton will be a disaster on jobs the economy trade healthcare the military guns and just about all else. Obama plus!

As expected the media is very much against me. Their dishonesty is amazing but just like our big wins in the primaries we will win!

Bernie Sanders must really dislike Crooked Hillary after the way she played him. Many of his supporters because of trade will come to me.

I would have had many millions of votes more than Crooked Hillary Clinton except for the fact that I had 16 opponents she had one!

Senator Sanders spent more than me yet lost.

THE PEOPLE NEED TRUMP2 make USA RICH!

Number one presidency of all time

Top RINO hack for MSNBC Joey Scarborough on the air and calling the next President Trump a racist and bigot. Shame on you

Nobody is watching Morning Joe anymore. Gone off the deep end - bad ratings. You won't believe what I am watching now!

Vote for me at least you'll have a job.

Thank you to all for your wonderful comments on my speech. I could feel the electricity in thr air. Great reviews - most votes ever recieved

In just out book Secret Service Agent Gary Byrne doesn't believe that Crooked Hillary has the temperament or integrity to be the president!

A former Secret Service Agent for President Clinton excoriates Crooked Hillary describing her as ERRATIC & VIOLENT. Bad temperament for pres

See when I said NATO was obsolete because of no terrorism protection they made the change without giving me credit.

My next project is pretty amazing!

Remembering the fallen heroes on DDay. 

I am getting bad marks from certain pundits because I have a small campaign staff. But small is good flexible save money and number one!

A massive blow to Obama's message - only 38000 new jobs for month in just issued jobs report. That's REALLY bad!

Crooked Hillary is being badly criticized (for a Wall Street paid for ad) by PolitiFact for a false ad on me on women. She is a total fraud!

Crooked Hillary Clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months. Her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions!

Just like I have been able to spend far less money than  others on the campaign and finish #1 so too should our country. We can be great!

People at NBC report on my campaign but have zero access. They say what they want without any knowledge.True of so much of media!

Hillary Clinton is unfit to be president. She has bad judgement poor leadership skills and a very bad and destructive track record. Change!

I am watching CNN very little lately because they are so biased against me. Shows are predictable garbage! CNN and MSM is one big lie!

The Clinton News Network sometimes referred to as @CNN is getting more and more biased.They act so indignant-hear them behind closed doors

Our ineffective POTUS has to make a speech in Elkhart to make everything look great.n

Thank you Attorney General Gonzales so many people feel this way.  

We just had the worst jobs report since 2010.

The Mayor of San Jose did a terrible job of ordering the  protection of innocent people. The thugs were lucky supporters remained peaceful!

Many of the thugs that attacked the peaceful Trump supporters in San Jose were illegals. They burned the American flag and laughed at police.

Heres The HILLARY UNIVERSITY Scandal No One In The Media Is Talking About 

Muhammad Ali is dead at 74! A truly great champion and a wonderful guy. He will be missed by all!

Great evening in San Jose other than the thugs. My supporters are far tougher if they want to be but fortunately they are not hostile.

So much interest in my visit to Scotland! I greatly look forward to attending the opening event @TrumpTurnberry- taking place on June 24th.

I'm a former chief of police in a border town. I'm Hispanic I'm proud to be Hispanic and I'm 100% behind Trump." 

In Crooked Hillary's telepromter speech yesterday she made up things that I said or believe but have no basis in fact. Not honest!

I don't watch or do @Morning_Joe anymore. Small audience low ratings! I hear Mika has gone wild with hate. Joe is Joe. They lost their way!

Rally last night in San Jose was great. Tremendous love and enthusiasm in the hall. Big crowd. Outside small group of thugs burned Am flag!

Terrible jobs report just reported. Only 38000 jobs added. Bombshell!

I think the first female president of the USA will be Ivanka Trump a beautiful intelligent young genuine successful lady!

I think the first female president of the USA will be Ivanka Trump a beautiful intelligent young genuine successful lady!

I think the first female president of the USA will be Ivanka Trump a beautiful intelligent young genuine successful lady!

Clinton says I'm dangerous. Who's the one who killed 4 Americans in Benghazi?  

Looks like several legal Hispanics supporting Trump! They know he will be good for them too.

Back to the USA to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

After Scotland I will visit @rumpDoonbeg in Ireland the magnificent resort fronting on the Atlantic Ocean.

Beautiful article about me written by my friend the incredibly talented golfer Natalie Gulbis. 

Only Trump can save America. Right leader at the right time. THANK YOU!

She's a criminal and I'm the only person that can stop her.

THIS IS @POTUS'S LEGACY! AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER!!! WE NEED to MAGA now! 

A vote for Trump is a vote to restore our great country.

A 60% increase in Texas Blue Cross/Blue Shield through ObamaCare. I told you so there is panic and anger as healthcare costs explode!

So great to have the endorsement and support of Paul Ryan. We will both be working very hard to Make America Great Again!

Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton! Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn't even look presidential!

Crooked Hillary no longer has credibility - too much failure in office. People will not allow another four years of incompetence!

Crooked Hillary Clinton who I would love to call Lyin' Hillary is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions.

After the litigation is disposed of and the case won I have instructed my execs to open Trump U(?) so much interest in it! I will be pres.

Even though I have a very biased and unfair judge in the Trump U civil case in San Diego I have thousands of great reviews & will win case!

With all of the Crooked Hillary Clinton's foreign policy experience she has made so many mistakes - and I mean real monsters! No more HRC.

Join me in San Jose California- tonight! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 Tickets: 

Wow USA Today did todays cover story on my record in lawsuits. Verdict: 450 wins 38 losses. Isn't that what you want for your president?

Do you ever notice that CNN gives me very little proper representation on my policies. Just watched-nobody knew anything about my foreign P

Bernie Sanders was right when he said that Crooked Hillary Clinton was not qualified to be president because she suffers from BAD judgement!

Crooked Hillary Clinton has zero natural talent - she should not be president. Her temperament is bad and her decision making ability-zilch!

Same failing New York Times "reporter" who wrote discredited women's story last week wrote another terrible story on me today- will never learn!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is a fraud who has put the public and country at risk by her illegal and very stupid use of e-mails. Many missing!

So I raised/gave $5600000 for the veterans and the media makes me look bad! They do anything to belittle - totally biased.

Congratulations to Sean Hannity on his tremendous increase in television ratings. Speaking of ratings- I will be on his show tonight

I am getting great credit for my press conference today. Crooked Hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days.

Katie Couric the third rate reporter who has been largely forgotten should be ashamed of herself for the fraudulent editing of her doc.

So many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money I raised/gave! It was my great honor - they do an amazing job.

Just finished a press conference in Trump Tower wherein I gave information on which VETERANS groups got the $5600000 that I raised/gave!

I have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great VETERANS and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so. Watch!

So many great things happening - new poll numbers looking good! News conference at 11:00 A.M. today Trump Tower!

I should have easily won the Trump University case on summary judgement but have a judge Gonzalo Curiel who is totally biased against me.

I have a judge in the Trump University civil case Gonzalo Curiel (San Diego) who is very unfair. An Obama pick. Totally biased-hates Trump

I hope everyone had a great Memorial Day!

I would have had millions of votes more in the primaries (than Crooked Hillary) if I only had one opponent instead of sixteen. Broke record

Have a great Memorial Day and remember that we will soon MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Illegals are taken care of better than our veterans.  

The endorsement of me by the 16500 Border Patrol Agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate. Nice!

In getting the endorsement of the 16500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you) the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary!

Obama says a WALL at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at W.H.

I will build the wall! That I can tell you!

If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent say good bye to the Supreme Court!

The Republican Party has to be smart & strong if it wants to win in November. Can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate!

Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser but if the GOP can't control their own then they are not a party. Be tough R's!

Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics- b/c I stand 100% behind everything we do.

Honor Memorial Day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country! We love them.

Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he's in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost. #MDW

Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me!

I am always on the front page of the failing New York Times but when I won the GOP nomination I'm in the back of the paper. Very dishonest!

The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money & get much better results! What we need as Prez!

The failing New York Times wrote a story about my management style & that I don't have many people. I have 73 Hillary has 800- & I'm beating her.

I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary - by a lot - and with many states left to go! Thank you.

The U.S. has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders. How nice but what do we get? NOT ENOUGH

Obama administration fails to screen Syrian refugees' social media accounts: 

Fantastic job on handling the thugs who tried to disrupt our very peaceful and well attended rally. Greatly appreciated!

Thank you Billy Joel. Many friends just told me you gave a very kind shoutout at MSG. Appreciate it- love your music!

Wow- 25000 in San Diego California! Thank you!!  

AN AMERICA FIRST ENERGY PLAN #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Poll data shows that Marco Rubio does by far the best in holding onto his Senate seat in Florida. Important to keep the MAJORITY. Run Marco!

Today we together won the Republican Nomination for President! 

My wife MELANIA TRUMP and my children will be featured on FoxNews

I find it offensive that Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas pretended to be Native American to get in Harvard.

Thank you Mr. & Mrs. Tom Barrack Jr for the wonderful and magical evening last night. It will not be forgotten.

The Inspector General's report on Crooked Hillary Clinton is a disaster. Such bad judgement and temperament cannot be allowed in the W.H.

Thank you Anaheim California! #Trump2016 

Thank you Washington! Honored to say on behalf of our great movement we have broken the all time record for votes in GOP primary history.

The protesters in New Mexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican flag. The rally inside was big and beautiful but outside criminals!

Crooked Hillary Clinton just can't close the deal with Bernie. I had to knock out 16 very good and smart candidates. Hillary doesn't have it

Goofy Senator Elizabeth Warren @elizabethforma has done less in the U.S. Senate than practically any other senator. All talk no action!

Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes known as Pocahontas bought foreclosed housing and made a quick killing. Total hypocrite!

Great rally in New Mexico amazing crowd! Now in L.A. Big rally in Anaheim.

After raising w/ no obligation almost $6M for Vets I couldn't believe protesters formed @ Trump Tower. JUST OUT- SENT BY CROOKED HILLARY!

I blame the dishonest media.

A wonderfully written article concerning Israel. 

A great new book has been written about Crooked Hillary. Read it & you will never be able to vote for her.

My favorite book is the bible, and second favorite Art of the Deal.

Crooked Hillary Clinton overregulates overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs. Most importantly she suffers from plain old bad judgement!

I just released my financial disclosure forms the largest numbers in the history of the F.E.C. Even the dishonest media thinks great!

Amazingly with all of the money I have raised for the vets I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media.

Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups.

While under no obligation to do so I have raised between 5 & 6 million dollars including 1million dollars from me for our VETERANS. Nice!

Obamas VA Secretary just said we shouldn't measure wait times. Hillary says VA problems are not widespread. I will take care of our vets!

Is Hillary really protecting women? 

In trade military and EVERYTHING else it will be AMERICA FIRST! This will quickly lead to our ultimate goal: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

The American people are sick and tired of not being able to lead normal lives and to constantly be on the lookout for terror and terrorists!

Bernie Sanders is continuing his quest because he believes that Crooked Hillary Clinton will be forced out of the race - e-mail scandal!

Crooked Hillary wants a radical 500% increase in Syrian refugees. We cant allow this. Time to get smart and protect America!

How can Crooked Hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical Islam which horribly oppresses women?

BREAKING POLL: Trump Gains 11 Points on Clinton Since March. Now Leads Crooked Hillary 46-44 

Why do the networks continue to put dopey Bill Kristol on panels when he has called every single shot about me wrong for 2 yrs?

Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad! Would be four more years of stupidity!

Crooked Hillary said that I  want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong!

I WILL do the right thing for the U.S.A without a doubt.

Thank you to all of the men and women who have served our country. You are our true heroes! #ArmedForcesDay 

Crooked Hillary Clintons foreign interventions unleashed ISIS in Syria Iraq and Libya. She is reckless and dangerous!

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

CNN is so negative getting even worse as I get closer. Just had two anti-Trump losers with zero rebuttal from my team. Turning off!

Hillary wants to rip the guns out of America's hands. No guns = no protection. Get on #TrumpTrain & join NRA to stop her.

Crooked Hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed. No more guns to protect Hillary!

While our wonderful president was out playing golf all day the TSA is falling apart just like our government! Airports a total disaster!

Crooked Hillary is spending tremendous amounts of Wall Street money on false ads against me. She is a very dishonest person!

Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment. No gun owner can ever vote for Clinton!

Colin great to have you at Trump Turnberry. So proud of you and your GREAT playing! You made winning MAJORS look easy!

Best Links Course in Britain. Ailsa Course opens June '16 Can't wait to play it 

We will not disappoint!

Great day in Kentucky with Wayne LaPierre and the NRA!  

Failing New York Times will always take a good story about me and make it bad. Every article is unfair and biased. Very sad!

Trump is the most unpredictable extraordinary entertaining & massively popular candidate this country has ever seen.

I am on my way! See you all soon! 

Crooked Hillary can't even close the deal with Bernie - and the Dems have it rigged in favor of Hillary. Four more years of this? No way!

Crooked Hillary Clinton looks presidential? I don't think so! Four more years of Obama and our country will never come back. ISIS LAUGHS!

Look where the world is today a total mess and ISIS is still running around wild. I can fix it fast Hillary has no chance!

Crooked Hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina. ISIS China Russia and all would love for her to be president. 4 more years!

I said that Crooked Hillary Clinton is "not qualified" to be president because she has "very bad judgement" - Bernie said the same thing!

Looks like yet another terrorist attack. Airplane departed from Paris. When will we get tough smart and vigilant? Great hate and sickness!

My list of potential U.S. Supreme Court Justices was very well recieved. During the next number of weeks I may be adding to the list!

Some low-life journalist claims that I "made a pass" at her 29 years ago. Never happened! Like the @nytimes story which has become a joke!

Why did Clinton supporters declare Crooked Hillary winner in KY when AP hasn't even called the race?

Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Democrats - the system is rigged against him. Many of his disenfranchised fans are for me!

Paul Begala the dopey CNN flunky and head of the Pro-Hillary Clinton Super PAC has knowingly committed fraud in his first ad against me.

Trump for President! Bernie is a joke knows nothing - and Hillary is yesterday's and today's nightmare

The Trump movement will not be stopped. We support Trump because he is a true American looking out for #AmericaFIRST.

Congratulations to THE MOVEMENT we have just won THE GREAT STATE OF OREGON. The vote percentage is even higher than anticipated! Thank you.

Hillary Just Handed me a huge Gift. Promising to Put Bubba in Charge of the Economy!

No way I believe Trump at 70% disapproval with women. Went to 3 rallies. At least 1/2 women. MSM Lies! MSM Lies!

Michael Barbaro the author of the now discredited New York Times hit piece on me with women has in past tweeted badly about me. He should resign

He will destroy Hillary but why give CNN record breaking ratings CNN can go to hell. Trump 2016

I look so forward to debating Crooked Hillary Clinton! Democrat Primaries are rigged e-mail investigation is rigged - so time to get it on!

I can't believe that @CNN would allow the very nice Jeffrey Lord to be savaged by a panel of seven Trump haters. 7 to 1 - Don't watch CNN!

I am a pillar of strength and will be perfect as our next president

Well that is it. Well done Megyn --- and they all lived happily ever after! Now let us all see how "THE MOVEMENT" does in Oregon tonight!

Will go back on for a final question now! Amazing job

Great interview! Happy you had a chance to show the other side. Never change never forget you are our messenger!

I like Michael Douglas!

I like Michael Douglas!

Best interview that I have ever seen.

One thing we know for sure Bernie Sanders supporters will turn to #Trump - absolutely not HillaryClinton

I speak from the heart for all of America. His intention is for a positive future for all. 

Wall Street paid for ad is a fraud just like Crooked Hillary! Their main line had nothing to do with women and they knew it. Apologize?

Do you think Crooked Hillary will finally close the deal? If she can't win Kentucky she should drop out of race. System rigged! 

I look forward to watching Megan Kelly. It will be interesting to see how she treats me. I think she will be very fair.

How can Crooked Hillary put her husband in charge of the economy when he was responsible for NAFTA the worst economic deal in U.S. history?

Crooked Hillary said her husband is going to be in charge of the economy.If so he should runnot her.Will he bring the "energizer" to D.C.?

Crooked Hillary can't close the deal with Bernie Sanders. Will be another bad day for her!

Amazing that Crooked Hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the WORST abuser of woman in U.S. political history

Oregon is voting today. Keep the big numbers going - VOTE TRUMP! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women. Can't believe she would misrepresent the facts! My hit was on China

The pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. "You can tell them to go BLANK themselves" - was about China NOT WOMEN!

Wow 30000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar! How can she run?

Wow 30000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar! How can she run?

Wow 30000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar! How can she run?

What Barbara Res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly and for years trying to come back. I said no.

I gave a woman named Barbara Res a top N.Y. construction job when that was unheard of and now she is nasty. So much for a nice thank you!

In politics and in life ignorance is not a virtue." This is a primary reason that President Obama is the worst president in U.S. history!

The writer of the now proven false story in the New York Times Michael Barbaro who was interviewed on CBS this morning was unable to respond.

Over 50 women were interviewed by the New York Times yet they only wrote about 6. Thats because there were so many positive statements.

No wonder the New York Times is failing who can believe what they write after the false malicious & libelous story they did on me.

The failing New York Times is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women. 

With the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing New York Times hit piece on me we have exposed the article as a fraud!

A political commentator for CNN which I no longer watch said "Trump showed some weakness in the Repub Primaries." I set all-time record!

The New York Times is so dishonest. Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer who said it was a lie!

That was an amazing interview on Fox and Friends - I hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the New York Times is!

Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Dems. The system is rigged against him. He should run as an independent! Run Bernie run.

The Washington Post report on potential VP candidates is wrong. Marco Rubio and most others mentioned are NOT under consideration.

Thank you Georgia! See you soon! #Trump2016 

The media is really on a witch-hunt against me. False reporting and plenty of it - but we will prevail!

Why did the failing New York Times refuse to use any of the names given to them that I was so proud to have helped with their careers. DISHONEST!

Wow I have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing New York Times piece. Massive front page for that!

Why doesn't the failing New York Times write the real story on the Clintons and women? The media is TOTALLY dishonest!

New York Times keep shining....the ppl will not let the media dim your light...we no longer believe them! #Trump2016" Thanks.

Everyone continues to pile onto me but they can NEVER take away our votes!"  Thank you!

Everyone is laughing at the New York Times for the lame hit piece they did on me and women.I gave them many names of women I helped-refused to use

OHIO WOMEN FOR TRUMP 

OHIO WOMEN FOR TRUMP 

OHIO WOMEN FOR TRUMP 

OHIO WOMEN FOR TRUMP 

We seem to have the same trajectory both were written off but they keep scaling the heights. History?

The failing New York Times wrote yet another hit piece on me. All are impressed with how nicely I have treated women they found nothing. A joke!

Wow CNN is really working hard to make me look as bad  as possible. Very unprofessional. Hurting in ratings - bad television! Great new poll- thank you! 

If Crooked Hillary Clinton can't close the deal on Crazy Bernie how is she going to take on China Russia ISIS and all of the others?

An incredible honor to receive the endorsement of a person I have such tremendous respect for. Thank you Sheldon! 

Your story about me & the carbon tax is absolutely incorrect. It is just the opposite. I will not support or endorse a carbon tax!

Senator Lindsey Graham called me yesterday very much to my surprise and we had a very interesting talk about national security and more!

If it were up to goofy Elizabeth Warren wed have no jobs in Americashe doesnt have a clue.

In interview I told AP that my taxes are under routine audit and I would release my tax returns when audit is complete not after election!

Isnt it funny when a failed Senator like goofy Elizabeth Warren can spend a whole day tweeting about Trump & gets nothing done in Senate?

Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage. See mediaasking for increase!

Our Native American Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren couldnt care less about the American workerdoes nothing to help!

Goofy Elizabeth Warren is now using the womans card like her friend crooked Hillary. See her dumb tweet when a woman stands up to you

If the people of Massachusetts found out what an ineffective Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren has been she would lose! Thanks Piers. 

'Duck Dynasty' star Phil Robertson says he'll back Trump for president 

Goofy Elizabeth Warren didnt have the guts to run for POTUS. Her phony Native American heritage stops that and VP cold.

Goofy Elizabeth Warren has been one of the least effective Senators in the entire U.S. Senate. She has done nothing!

I don't want to hit Crazy Bernie Sanders too hard yet because I love watching what he is doing to Crooked Hillary. His time will come!

Big wins in West Virginia and Nebraska. Get ready for November - Crooked Hillary who is looking very bad against Crazy Bernie will lose!

The Clintons spend millions on negative ads on me & I cant tell the truth about her husband? Dont feel sorry for crooked Hillary!

Hillary has bad judgment! 

It was so great being in Nebraska last week. Today is the big day--get out and vote!

I look very much forward to meeting w/Paul Ryan & the GOP Party Leadership on Thurs in DC. Together we will beat the Dems at all levels!

It is only the people that were never asked to be VP that tell the press that they will not take the position.

It was Rosie O'Donnell who ate the cake in the vicious Hillary commercial about me not Crooked Hillary!

Why does the media with a strong push from Crooked Hillary keep pushing the false narrative that I want to raise taxes. Exactly opposite!

Great job on Fox and Friends this morning. Thank you for the nice words!

For Our Children: Let's Elect Donald Trump 

I am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate. Any negotiated increase by Congress to my proposal would still be lower than current!

I will have set the all time record in primary votes in the Republican party --despite having to compete against 17 other people!

If I only had 1 person running against me in the primaries like Hillary Clinton I would have gotten 10 million more votes than she did!

Crooked Hillary Clinton says that she got more primary votes than Donald Trump. But I had 17 people to beatshe had one!  A nasty guy with no heart!

Is Chris serious lying or misinformed? Bill Clinton signed NAFTA. 

The liars that signed the pledge and now won't support me. The reason they are losers. A nasty guy with no heart!

Wow I hear Morning Joe has gone really hostile ever since I said I won't do or watch the show anymore.They misrepresent my positions!

Russell Moore is truly a terrible representative of Evangelicals and all of the good they stand for. A nasty guy with no heart!


Crooked Hillary just can't close the deal with Bernie. It will be the same way with ISIS and China on trade and Mexico at the border. Bad!

Kellyanne you were fantastic on Meet The Press today. Keep going - I will win for the people. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! HappyMothersDay!  

Kellyanne you were fantastic on Meet The Press today. Keep going - I will win for the people. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! HappyMothersDay! 

Kellyanne you were fantastic on Meet The Press today. Keep going - I will win for the people. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! HappyMothersDay! 

I want a leader that will shoot straight with us. The politicians can't.

Remember when the two failed presidential candidates Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush signed a binding PLEDGE? They broke the deal no honor!

I am honored that the great men and women of the @Teamsters have created a movement from within called Teamsters for Trump! Thank you.

I am going to keep our jobs in the U.S. and totally rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. Crooked Hillary has no clue! @Teamsters

Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk no action -- maybe her Native American name?

Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts.

Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me.

Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant but leaves behind amazing legacy.

Goofy Elizabeth Warren Hillary Clintons flunky has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American.

Lets properly check goofy Elizabeth Warrens records to see if she is Native American. I say shes a fraud!

I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.

I hear JoeNBC of rapidly fading Morning_Joe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run. This will guarantee a Crooked Hillary win.

Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed then John Kasich and that didn't work. Not much power or insight!

Thank you to teachers across America! When I become POTUS we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now.

Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability. As Bernie Sanders says she has bad judgement. Constantly playing the women's card - it is sad!

Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special the Republican Party. Wrong I didn't inherit it I won it with millions of voters! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill.

Many would say that you are the only talented person running for the top job this time!

So many great endorsements yesterday except for Paul Ryan! We must put America first and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill.

Governor Rick Perry said "Donald Trump is one of the most talented people running for the Presidency I've ever seen." Thank you Rick!

Unlike crooked Hillary Clinton who wants to destroy all miners I want wages to go up in America. We will do so by bringing back jobs! I love Hispanics! 

Thank you West Virginia. Let's keep it going. Go out and vote on Tuesday - we will win big. #Trump2016

Can you believe Crooked Hillary said "We are going to put a whole lot of coal miners&coal companies out of business." She then apologized. I love Hispanics! 

Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats. Both with delegates & otherwise. He should show them & run as an Independent.

Happy #CincoDeMayo! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! 

I love Hispanics!

I love Hispanics! 

I love Hispanics! 

I will be interviewed by @BretBaier @SpecialReport at 6pm ET tonight @FoxNews

Many reports that I will be attending the Alvarez/Khan fight this weekend in Vegas. Totally untrue! Unfortunately I have other plans.

The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill.

I would rather run against Crooked Hillary Clinton than Bernie Sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against Bernie!

What a great evening we had. So interesting that Sanders beat Crooked Hillary. The dysfunctional system is totally rigged against him!

Please correct I WON Virginia!

Thank you Indiana we were just projected to be the winner. We have won in every category. You are very special people-I will never forget!

Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will and must win Indiana. If he doesn't he should drop out of the race-stop wasting time & money.

Wow Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure - not very presidential. Sad!

I will be campaigning in Indiana all day. Things are looking great and the support of Bobby Knight has been so amazing. Today will be fun!

Everybody is talking about the protesters burning the American flags and proudly waving Mexican flags. I want America First - so do voters!

Gov Mike Pence has just stated that Donald Trump has taken a strong stance on Hoosier jobs and he thanks me! I will bring back jobs to USA.

Crooked Hillary Clinton said she is used to "dealing with men who get off the reservation." Actually she has done poorly with such men!

Karl Rove is a failed Jeb Bushy. Never says anything good & never will even after I beat Hillary. Shouldn't be on the air!

I am on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace- his 20th year anniversary with Fox News! 

I watched Sen. Graham Face The Nation. Why don't they say that I ran him out of the race like a little boy and in the end he had no support? Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will and must win Indiana. If he doesn't he should drop out of the race-stop wasting time & money.

Wow Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure - not very presidential. Sad! 

The economy is bad and getting worse-almost ZERO growth this quarter. Nobody can beat me on the economy (and jobs). MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

The "protesters" in California were thugs and criminals. Many are professionals. They should be dealt with strongly by law enforcement!

Anderson so amazing. Your mother is and always has been an incredible woman!

We are now at 1001 delegates. We will win on the first ballot and are not wasting time and effort on other ballots because system is rigged!

Crooked Hillary Clinton perhaps the most dishonest person to have ever run for the presidency is also one of the all time great enablers!

Wow the ridiculous deal made between Lyin'Ted Cruz and 1 for 42 John Kasich has just blown up. What a dumb deal - dead on arrival!

New York Yankees President Randy Levine: 'End of the Republican Party' If Donald Trump Not Nominated.   

So many false and phony T.V. commercials being broadcast in Indiana. Reminds me of Florida where thousands were put up-I won in a landslide!

I will be in Evansville Indiana with the great Bobby Knight (who last night endorsed me) at 12:00 this afternoon. See you there!

Lyin' Ted Cruz who can never beat Hillary Clinton and has NO path to victory has chosen a V.P.candidate who failed badly in her own effort

Thank you to all for the wonderful reviews of my foreign policy speech. I will soon be speaking in great detail on numerous other topics!

Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will and must win Indiana. If he doesn't he should drop out of the race-stop wasting time & money.

Wow Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure - not very presidential. Sad!

I cried when they said you made a clean sweep of all 5 states. I was SO HAPPY!

Getting the strong endorsement of the great coach Bobby Knight has been a highlight of my stay in Indiana. Big speech tomorrow with Bobby!

I am in Indiana where we just had a great rally. Fantastic people! Staying at a Holiday Inn Express - new and clean not bad! Thank you Laura!  

Thank you for the endorsement Coach Bobby Knight! I will never forget it! Thank you Newt! Thanks Dave! 

GREATEST FOREIGN POLICY SPEECH SINCE WASHINGTON'S FAREWELL ADDRESS.

Lets #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Maryland! #VoteTrump  

How bad is the New York Times the most inaccurate coverage constantly. Always trying to belittle. Paper has lost its way!

Thank you for the incredible support- Melania Barron Ivanka Jared Tiffany Don Vanessa Eric and Lara! 

Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democratsboth with delegates & otherwise. He should show them and run as an Independent! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

The Cruz-Kasich pact is under great strain. This joke of a deal is falling apart not being honored and almost dead. Very dumb!

Passing what was once a vibrant manufacturing area in Pennsylvania. So sad! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  

On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night!

Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work.

Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.

Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!

Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!

Wow just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!

I am happy to hear how badly the New York Times is doing. It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down. Becoming irrelevant!

I will be in Maryland this afternoon for a major rally. Things are looking good for Tuesday!

As soon as John Kasich is hit with negative ads he will drop like a rock in the polls against Crooked Hillary Clinton. I will win!

I had a great day campaigning in Connecticut. Looking for a big vote on Tuesday!

Congratulations to Sean Hannity on his great ratings and ratings increase as reported by the AP today. Amazing job!

Lynne Ryan -- just read your great story in the NY Times -- I am proud of you. Thanks! 

Cast your vote for Trump for POTUS & ALSO vote for the TRUMP DELEGATES in your congressional district! 

Will be spending the day campaigning in Connecticut another state where jobs are being stolen by other countries. I will stop this fast!

I met Prince on numerous occasions. He was an amazing talent and wonderful guy. He will be greatly missed!

Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted.

Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!

Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!

Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!

We are going to bring steel and manufacturing back to Indiana!

Had a meeting with the terrific @GovPenceIN of Indiana. So excited to campaign in his wonderful state! 

Ted Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race. Now all he can do is be a spoiler never a nice thing to do. I will beat Hillary! 

CNN is so negative it is impossible to watch. Terrible panel angry haters.    

1988 with Oprah, I discuss why I would never rule out a run for POTUS.

Who did the House Task Force on Urgent Fiscal Issues call- when America needed HELP?  

Lyin Ted Cruz even voted against Superstorm Sandy aid and September 11th help. So many New Yorkers devastated. Cruz hates New York!

New York we will make America great again! 

Kasich only looks O.K. in polls against Hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed ZERO negative ads against him

Lyin' Ted Cruz can't win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bosses-I am millions of VOTES ahead! Hillary would destroy him & Kasich

I will fix this corrupted rigged system. 4 no Profit Under budget & ahead of schedule.

I would have millions of votes more than Hillary except for the fact that I had 17 opponents and she just had a socialist named Bernie!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. I am the one person she doesn't want to run against. Will be such fun!

Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses. It won't work!

Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary. Despite a rigged delegate system I am hundreds of delegates ahead of him.

I'll be in one of my favorite places this morning Staten Island. Big crowd will be fun!

New CBS Poll shows defections from Cruz's core supporters & increased support for me. Not surprising.

I'm starting to believe that I'm actually going to WIN!

Just arrived in Syracuse NY. Big crowd great place! We will bring back the desperately needed jobs. #NYPrimary 

We are becoming a third world country because of jerks like him" Great! We are becoming a third world country because of jerks like him" Great!

We are becoming a third world country because of jerks like him" Great! Finally someone who actually cares about us!! 

Big protest march in Colorado on Friday afternoon! Don't let the bosses take your vote!

The rules DID CHANGE in Colorado shortly after I entered the race in June because the pols and their bosses knew I would win with the voters

Biggest story in politics is now happening in the great State of Colorado where over one million people have been precluded from voting!

Missouri just confirmed #Trump2016 as the official winner- with an additional 12 delegates. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

Leaving for Albany New York now massive crowd expected. Very exciting!

Why does the liberal media think Bill O'Reilly is a complete and total vulgarian? I don't think so!

Why does the liberal media think Bill O'Reilly is a complete and total vulgarian? I don't think so!

Colorado Trump Delegates Scratched from Ballots at GOP Convention 

This is happening all over our countrygreat people being disenfranchised by politicians. Repub party is in trouble! 

The people of Colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians. Biggest story in politics. This will not be allowed!

How is it possible that the people of the great State of Colorado never got to vote in the Republican Primary? Great anger - totally unfair!

I win a state in votes and then get non-representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign. Bad system!

The New York Times purposely covers me so inaccurately. I want other nations to pay the U.S. for our defense of them. We are the suckers-no more!

New Jersey Man Joseph Hornick Willing to Go to Jail for Flying Trump Flag

GOP is trying to steal nomination from the winner not block an insurgent catching up 2 frontrunner (Sanders).

I am the only person who can save us from this corrupt political mess. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Women love Mr Trump too. Will make it happen in New York on April 19. Go out & vote.

Bernie Sanders says that Hillary Clinton is unqualified to be president. Based on her decision making ability I can go along with that!

Isn't it a shame that the person who will have by far the most delegates and many millions more votes than anyone else me still must fight

Trump will be our best president since Reagan! Nobody beats me on National Security. Looks like I was right about NATO. I had no doubt. 

Jennifer is a terrific person. Trump Cruz is hated in New York. He should go home - no place for a phony. Ted Cruz attacked New Yorkers and New York values- we don't forget! 

Jennifer is a terrific person. Trump Cruz is hated in New York. He should go home - no place for a phony. Ted Cruz attacked New Yorkers and New York values- we don't forget! 

Unbelievable evening. Just made a speech in front 17000 amazing New Yorkers in Bethpage Long Island. Great to be home! Pure fiction!

It is so great to be back home! Looking forward to a great rally tonight in Bethpage Long Island!

Wow Politico is in total disarray  with almost everybody quitting. Good news. Bad dishonest journalists! 

DonaldTrump is the only guy I think that has the will & the nerve to attack & to fight. 

VERY close to my heart. I'm a NAVY VET! I love VETERANS ADMINISTRATION REFORMS. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Wow great news from Wisconsin. Just made two speeches there with a big one coming tonight. Thank you! 

A great day in Wisconsin many stops many great people! Melania is joining me on Monday. Big crowds. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I don't care about the game I care about the PEOPLE. And that's exactly why WE THE PEOPLE love you so much! #Trump2016

CNN is reviewing the weekbut majority of the show about me because there would be 0.0 ratings if not. Media's a JOKE. Enjoy!

Thank you for your nice words on Fox today. They never use my full statements on nuclear which you would agree with!

Great honor to have GOP General Counsel John Ryder as a Trump delegate in TN. RNC meeting well worth it! Unifying the party!

Wisconsin has suffered a great loss of jobs and trade but if I win all of the bad things happening in the U.S. will be rapidly reversed!

I will be in Wisconsin until the election. Jobs trade and immigration will be big factors. I will bring jobs back home - make great deals!

If Megan Kelly stopped covering me on her show her ratings would drop like a rock! My h to h interview with Anderson Cooper beat her by millions! Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? 

Is it possible for Megan Kelly to cover anyone but Donald Trump on her terrible show. She totally misrepresents my words and positions! BAD. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! BAD.

Can you believe that Ted Cruz who has been killing our country on trade for so long just put out a Wisconsin ad talking about trade? We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States! 

We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States!

We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States!

We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States! We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States! Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? 

For the 1st time in American history Americas 16500 border patrol agents have issue a presidential primary endorsementme! Thank you.

The National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) said that our open border is the biggest physical & economic threat facing the American people! Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? 

The Club For Growth said in their ad that 465 delegates (Cruz) plus 143 delegates (Kasich) is more than my 739 delegates. Try again! Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? 

The Club For Growth which asked me for $10000 in an extortion attempt just put up a Wisconsin ad with incorrect math.What a dumb group! Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? 

Just had a very nice meeting with Reince Priebus and the @GOP. Looking forward to bringing the Party together and it will happen! The Trump Doctrine: Peace Through Strength. Nothing you say will change my mind! Congratulations to CNN for having the wisdom to pick TRUMP! 

Nice piece and video today in the Wall Street Journal: Trumps three eldest children jump into campaign 

David Gregory got thrown off of TV by NBC fired like a dog! Now he is on CNN being nasty to me. Not nice!

Final numbers's just announced in the GREAT State of MO. TRUMP WINS! New certified #'s show a 365 vote increase for me- @ least 12 more delegates!

Why is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference? What is in her hand??

Why is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference? What is in her hand??

This was the reporters statement- when she found out there was tape from my facility she changed her tune. 

Victory press conference was over.  Why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions? Can I press charges? 

Why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened that is before she found out the episode was on tape?

Wow Corey Lewandowski my campaign manager and a very decent man was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there!

How come the @TODAYshow & @chucktodd show the new @NBCNews Poll for Hillary vs Bernie but do not show the SAME poll where I am killing Cruz?

I have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC.

Wow CNN has nothing but my opponents on their shows. Really one-sided and unfair reporting. Maybe I shouldn't do their town-hall tonight!

We need to secure our borders ASAP. No games we must be smart tough and vigilant. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN & MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN!

Lyin' Ted I have already beaten you in all debates and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates. You should focus on jobs & illegal imm!

Lyin'Ted Cruz is weak & losing big so now he wants to debate again. But according to DrudgeTime and on-line polls I have won all debates

After the way I beat Gov. Scott Walker (and Jeb Rand Marco and all others) in the Presidential Primaries no way he would ever endorse me!

Cruz will say anything that is contrary to what you have to say. If you're for Motherhood he'll be against it!

Just released that international gangs are all over our cities. This will end when I am President!

Ted Cruz is incensed that I want to refocus NATO on terrorism as well as current mission but also want others to PAY FAIR SHARE a must!

A detainee released from Gitmo has killed an American. When will our so-called "leaders" ever learn!

The United States cannot continue to make such bad one-sided trade deals. There are only so many jobs we can give up. No more!

See Lyin' Ted even the DailyBeast says this story came from Rubio not Trump! 

Just to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than Cruz-Lawsuit coming

Why can't the pundits be honest? Hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again. I will make it strong and great!  JOBS!

Another radical Islamic attack this time in Pakistan targeting Christian women & children. At least 67 dead400 injured. I alone can solve

Happy Easter to all have a great day!

My statement on NATO being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive (and unfair) for the U.S. are now finally receiving plaudits!

Wow sleepy eyes Chuck Todd is at it again. He is do totally biased. The things I am saying are correct. - far better vision than the others

Remember I am the only candidate who is self-funding. While I am given little credit for this by the voters I am not bought like others!

Don't believe the Fox News Polls they are just another phony hit job on me. I will beat Hillary Clinton easily in the General Election.

Wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in U.S. jobs are leaving. I will make our economy strong again - bring in jobs

Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J. Trump. Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong. Illegals out!

Lyin' Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enq.were caused by me. I had NOTHING to do with story!

The press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women when they know that it is just the opposite!

The media is so after me on women  Wow this is a tough business. Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump!

Your instincts on foreign policy & terrorism have been better than all of these so called experienced politicians combined.

Top suspect in Paris massacre Salah Abdeslam who also knew of the Brussels attack is no longer talking. Weak leaders ridiculous laws!

Lyin Ted blames me for so many things I am starting to think he is having a mental health crisis.

Lyin Ted blames me for so many things I am starting to think he is having a mental health crisis.

Wow just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me. How am I still number one - by a lot?

I didn't start the fight with Lyin'Ted Cruz over the GQ cover pic of Melania he did. He knew the PAC was putting it out - hence Lyin' Ted!

Just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the Trump U case but the press refuses to write about it. If I lost-monster story! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Europe and the U.S. must immediately stop taking in people from Syria. This will be the destruction of civilization as we know it! So sad!

Just announced that as many as 5000 ISIS fighters have infiltrated Europe. Also many in U.S.  I TOLD YOU SO! I alone can fix this problem!

They're all brain-dead puppets with skeletons in their closet. I say you go on and destroy them all" A dead show

Explain how the women on The View which is a total disaster since the great Barbara Walters left ever got their jobs. @abc is wasting time

The View which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air is constantly asking me to go on.

The View which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air is constantly asking me to go on. I TELL THEM "NO

Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years. TIME FOR A CHANGE I WILL SOLVE AND FAST! Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years. TIME FOR A CHANGE I WILL SOLVE AND FAST!

It is amazing how often I am right only to be criticized by the media. Illegal immigration take the oil build the wall Muslims NATO!

Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a "hell hole" and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article. I was so right!

These politicians like Cruz and Graham who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years do nothing to make things better!

Lindsay Graham and Lyin' Ted Cruz are two politicians who are very much alike - ALL TALK AND NO ACTION! Both talk about ISIS do nothing!

It is amazing how Lindsey Graham gets on so many T.V. shows talking negatively about me when I beat him so badly in his pres run!

Thank God is not a politician but he's one heck of a fighter who will fight for us the people.

We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of N.A.T.O. Why? It is time to renegotiate and the time is now!

N.A.T.O. is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on!

I want to thank Joe for all of his help in our historic Arizona win. Could not have done it without you Joe!

While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race!

I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted. Jeb spent more than $1500000 and got nothing. I spent a fraction of that and am first!

I will be the best by far in fighting terror. Im the only one that was right from the beginning & now Lyin Ted & others are copying me.

Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror. Shes been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are!

Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates Lyin Ted Cruz. Honestly I cant blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion!

Lyin Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me and lines from Michael Douglas just another dishonest politician.

Thank you Arizona! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpTrain 

Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania. That's why we call him Lyin' Ted!

Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices!

Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona. Thank you I will never forget!

Incompetent Hillary despite the horrible attack in Brussels today wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in.  No way!

Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful Lyin' Ted or I will spill the beans on your wife!

Pres. Obama should leave the baseball game in Cuba immediately & get home to Washington- where a #POTUS under a serious emergency belongs!

Obama and all others have been so weak and so politically correct that terror groups are forming and getting stronger! Shame.

My heart & prayers go out to all of the victims of the terrible Brussels tragedy. This madness must be stopped and I will stop it.

Watch this clip from earlier this year. Time & time again I have been right about terrorism. Its time to get tough! 

I have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody- and its not even close. Hopefully AZ and UT will be voting for me today!

President Obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in Cuba especially in the shadows of Brussels. He is being treated badly!

Do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place Brussels was. Not anymore it is from a different world! U.S. must be vigilant and smart! The media is corrupt! We The People are fighting with you.

Wow President Obama just landed in Cuba a big deal and Raul Castro wasn't even there to greet him. He greeted Pope and others. No respect

So the highly overrated anchor Megan Kelly is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show but I can't fight back? Wrong!

The protesters blocked a major highway yesterday delaying entry to my RALLY in Arizona by hours and the media blames my supporters!

Why is it that the horrendous protesters who scream curse punch shut down roads/doors during my RALLIES  are never blamed by media? SAD!

The rallies in Utah and Arizona were great! Tremendous crowds and spirit. Just returned but will be going back soon.

You are a true journalistic professional. I so agree with what you say. Keep up the great work! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Watching your show from Arizona where we just had a big rally. It is fantastic- everybody loves it!

Wow @CNN ratings are up 75% because it's "all Trump all the time." The networks are making a fortune off of me! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

If crazy Megan Kelly didn't cover me so much on her terrible show her ratings would totally tank. She is so average in so many ways!

Crazy Megan Kelly says I don't (won't) go on her show and she still gets good ratings. But almost all of her shows are negative hits on me! LYIN' TED 

Honored to be in Utah with retired General Robert C. Oaks. We are so thankful for his support and endorsement here.

Reading New York times is a total waste of time he is a clown with no awareness of the world around him- dummy!

While I have never met New York Times of the NY Times I consider him one of the dumbest of all pundits- he has no sense of the real world!

Just leaving Salt Lake City Utah- fantastic crowd with no interruptions.  Love Utah. I will be back! Utah Speaker of the House announces endorses me! 

Why haven't they released the final Missouri victory for us yet? Could it be because Cruz's guy runs Missouri?

I guess I have reached yet another "ceiling"  - 49.7% with four people. My highest Reuters poll yet! Thank you! 

Do you believe that Hillary Clinton now wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants? She should spend more time taking care of our great Vets! LYIN' TED 

Everybody should boycott the Megan Kelly show. Never worth watching. Always a hit on Trump! She is sick & the most overrated person on tv.

Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost! Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary

Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost! Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary

Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost! Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary

Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney was campaigning with John Kasich & Marco Rubio and now he is endorsing Ted Cruz. 1/2

Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney the man who "choked" and let us all down is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz. This is good for me!

Going to Salt Lake City Utah for a big rally. Lyin' Ted Cruz should not be allowed to win there.  Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary. Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary

Club for Growth letter- trying to extort $10000.00 from me. Remember I said- NO! 

Club For Growth tried to extort $10000 from me. When I said NO they went hostile with negative ads. Disgraceful!

With millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment my numbers continue to go up. Can anyone explain this?

Eric Erickson got fired like a dog from RedState and now he is the one leading opposition against me.

Eric Erickson got fired like a dog from RedState and now he is the one leading opposition against me.

Eric Erickson got fired like a dog from RedState and now he is the one leading opposition against me.

Senator Lindsey Graham made horrible statements about Senator Ted Cruz  and then he endorsed him. No wonder nobody trusts politicians!

Lyin' Ted Cruz lost all five races on Tuesday-and he was just given the jinx - a Lindsey Graham endorsement. Also backed Jeb. Lindsey got 0!

Hillary Clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life!

Who should star in a reboot of Liar Liar- Hillary Clinton or Ted Cruz? Let me know. 

Highly overrated & crazy Megan Kelly is always complaining about Trump and yet she devotes her shows to me. Focus on others Megyn!

Looking like my 5 victories on Tuesday will be just as good as if I won Ohio. Two more days and Ohio was mine!

Please explain to the dummies at the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board that I love to debate and have won according to Drudge etc. all 11 of them!

Wall Street Journal is bad at math. The good news is nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore especially me!

The reason lyin' Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem! Wow just won Missouri!

Crazy Megan Kelly is now complaining that Bill did not defend her against me. Her bad show is a total hit piece on me.Tough!

Great news that FoxNews has cancelled the additional debate. How many times can the same people ask the same question? I beat Cruz debating. Wow just won Missouri!

Crazy Megan Kelly supposedly had lyin' Ted Cruz on her show last night. Ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse. Ted can't win!

Stuart Stevens the failed campaign manager of Mitt Romney's historic loss is now telling the Republican Party what to do with Trump. Sad! Wow just won Missouri!

RT @JohnStossel: I can skate here ONLY b/c @realdonaldtrump fixed this rink after NYC govt spent $13M but FAILED! Good for Trump! 

I am making a big speech the night of the @FoxNews debate but I wish everyone well. Yesterday was a big day for me with 5 wins!

Thank you to the Governor of Florida Rick Scott for your endorsement. I greatly appreciate your support! Thank you Little Marco I agree!

In the last 2 weeks I had $35M of negative ads against me in Florida & I won in a massive landslide. The establishment should save their money! Thank you Little Marco I agree!

Yesterday was five amazing victories. Lyin Ted Cruz had zero. Things are going very well! Is this what we want for a President? Thank you Little Marco I agree! 

I only wish my wonderful daughter Tiffany could have been with us at Mar-a-Lago for our great election victory. She is a winner! Thank you Little Marco I agree!

Can't watch Crazy Megyn anymore. Talks about me at 43% but never mentions that there are four people in race. With two people big & over!

If media wasn't so biased against me I would've won all of the delegates. Megan Kelly is trying so hard to bash me. Don't worry everyone is wise to Crazy Megyn!

Word is that despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads I had a massive victory in Florida. Numbers out soon!

A lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in Florida? Hope this is false.

I will bring our jobs back to the U.S. and keep our companies from leaving. Nobody else can do it. Our economy will "sing" again.

In presidential voting so far John Kasich is ZERO for 22. So why would he be a good candidate? Hillary would beat him I will beat Hillary!

Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico now losing Ford (and many others). Kasich is weak on illegal immigration. We need strong borders now!

Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. Remember him in second debate until I put him down.

Mathematically it is statistically impossible for Kasich to get to 1237. He would need 112% of the remaining delegates to beat me

North Carolina lost 300000 manufacturing jobs and Ohio lost 400000 since 2000. Going to Mexico etc. NO MORE IF I WIN WE WILL BRING BACK! LYIN' TED 

Don't reward Mitt Romney who let us all down in the last presidential race by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA open borders etc.). LYIN' TED 

Please remember I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists! LYIN' TED 

I will bring our jobs back to America fix our military and take care of our vets end Common Core and ObamaCare protect 2nd A build WALL

Rubio is weak on illegal immigration with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in many years. He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! LYIN' TED 

Kasich voted for NAFTA a disaster for Ohio and now wants the even worse TPP approved. Vote Trump and end this madness! Who started this mess the protesters of course . And media made it worse. LYIN' TED 

Sadly this kind of stuff even happened to Ronald Reagan. There is nothing nice about it! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain. Kasich has helped decimate the coal and steel industries in Ohio. I will bring them back! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Gov Kasich voted for NAFTA which devastated Ohio and is now pushing TPP hard- bad for American workers! LYIN' TED 

The failing @nytimes is truly one of the worst newspapers. They knowingly write lies and never even call to fact check. Really bad people!

Because Gov. Kasich cannot run in the state of Pennsylvania-he cannot win the nomination- & should not be allowed to compete in Ohio on Tue.

Carly Fiorina- I agree! Ted Cruz is just another politician. All talk- no action! LYIN' TED 

Thank you Kevin. With unification of the party Republican wins will be massive!  

Gov.Kasich of Ohio just stated on a morning show that he doesn't watch politics or anything on television he only watches the @GolfChannel

Ohio Gov.Kasich voted for NAFTA from which Ohio has never recovered. Now he wants TPP which will be even worse. Ohio steel and coal dying!

Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie or my supporters will go to yours!

Wow Kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of Pennsylvania not enough signatures. Big problem! LYIN' TED 

Chaos in Chicago was a planned attack. But Hillary insists it was a spontaneous reaction to an internet

USSS did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage. He has ties to ISIS. Should be in jail! 

Do the people of Ohio know that John Kasich is STRONGLY in favor of Common Core! In other words education of your children from D.C. No way!


Just finished my second speech. 20K in Dayton & 25K in Cleveland- perfectly behaved crowd. Thanks. I love you Ohio! 

It is Clinton and Sanders people who disrupted my rally in Chicago - and then they say I must talk to my people. Phony politicians!

The last person that Hillary or Bernie want to run against is Donald Trump and that is fact!

We are asking law enforcement to check for dishonest early voting in Florida- on behalf of little Marco Rubio.  No way to run a country!

Word is-early voting in FL is very dishonest. Little Marco his State Chairman & their minions are working overtime-trying to rig the vote. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

On my way to Dayton Ohio. Will be there soon!

The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled. Will be great - love you Ohio!

Ohio had the biggest budget increase in the U.S. If it were not for striking oil they would be bust! Governor Kasich in favor of TPP fraud!

Absentee Governor Kasich voted for NAFTA and NAFTA devastated Ohio - a disaster from which it never recovered. Kasich is good for Mexico!

The organized group of people many of them thugs who shut down our First Amendment rights in Chicago have totally energized America!

I just got off the phone with the great people of Guam! Thank you for your support! #VoteTrump today!

Great news! Thank you Governor Ralph DLG Torres! #Trump2016  

It means so much to me- receiving an endorsement from Phyllis Schlafly. A truly great woman & conservative. 

Thank you St. Louis Missouri!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Rumor has it that Politico is going out of business. Losing too much money. Great news! Likewise dopey Mort Zuckerman's. Dr. Ben Carson. I concur.

Probably with all pundits saying last fall I had no chance is that shows media so out of touch with Americans

Donald Trump is your man America. He is the best!! Vote for him!" Thank you!

Wow you are all correct about FoxNews - totally biased and disgusting reporting.

Phony Club For Growth tried to shake me down for one million dollars & is now putting out nasty negative ads on me. They are total losers!

Word is I am doing very well in Michigan and Mississippi! Wow and with all that money spent against me! Will be going to Trump Jupiter now!

I hear MSM came out with another one of their phony polls. While I am leading they are totally discredited after last S.C. poll
Aloha Hawaii: We would be honored to have your vote! Find your caucus 

The negative television commercials about me paid for by the politicians bosses are a total #Mediafraud. When you watch remember!

Mitt Romney had his chance and blew it. Lindsey Graham ran for president got ZERO and quit! Why are they now spokesmen against me? Sad!

Remember I am the only one who is self-funding my campaign. All of the other candidates are bought and paid for by special interests!

Sun Sentinel says: Rubio lacks the experience work ethic and gravitas needed to be president. HE HAS NOT EARNED YOUR VOTE!

Michigan Mississippi Idaho & Hawaii: Get out to VOTE and join the movement today! Video: 

The Club for Growth is a very dishonest group. They represent conservative values terribly & are bad for America. 

People forget it was Club for Growth that asked me for $1 million. I said no & they went negative. Extortion! 

Ted Cruz Was For Welcoming Syrian Refugees Before He Was Against It 

I employ many people in Hawaii at my great hotel in Honolulu. Ill be there very soon. Vote for me Hawaii!

Cruz came to Mississippi there was nobody there he left the state. I had a rally in Madison MS with 10000!  Thank you!

New ad concerning lightweight Senator Marco Rubio:  

Thank you Idaho! I love your potatoes-  nobody grows them better. As  President I will protect your market. 

Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio features Trump Univ. students in FL. attack ads- who submitted "excellent" reviews. 

It was great being in Michigan. Remember I am the only presidential candidate who will bring jobs back to the U.S.and protect car industry!

Don't believe the millions of dollars of phony television ads by lightweight Rubio and the R establishment. Dishonest people!

Leaving for North Carolina. Big crowd will be fun!

Congratulation to Adam Scott and all of the folks at Trump National Doral on producing a really great WGC Tournament. Amazing finish!

I will be using Facebook and Twitter to expose dishonest lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. A record no-show in Senate he is scamming Florida

We cannot let the failing REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT who could not stop Obama (twice) ruin the MOVEMENT with millions of  $'s in false ads!

Lindsey Graham is all over T.V. much like failed 47% candidate Mitt Romney. These nasty angry jealous  failures have ZERO credibility!

Failed presidential candidate Lindsey Graham should respect me. I destroyed his run brought him from 7% to 0% when he got out. Now nasty!

How do you fight millions of dollars of fraudulent commercials pushing for crooked politicians? I will be using Facebook & Twitter. Watch!

All of the phony T.V. commercials against me are bought and payed for by SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS the bandits that tell your pols what to do

I am at Trump National Doral-best resort in U.S. Rory and Adam Scott are doing great! Watch on NBC at 3:00 P.M.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Thank you to @jdickerson and @FaceTheNation for a very fair and professional interview this morning. No wonder you are #1 in the ratings!

Fraud lightweight Marco made a TV ad on TrumpU featuring 2 people who signed these letters: 

The primary plaintiff in the phony Trump University suit wants to abandon the case. Disgraceful!

Nancy Reagan the wife of a truly great President was an amazing woman. She will be missed!

David Brooks of the New York Times is closing in on being the dumbest of them all. He doesnt have a clue.

I am watching two clown announcers on Fox News as they try to build up failed presidential candidate Little Marco. Fox News is in the bag!

Romney's failed advisors like campaign mgr Stuart Stevens are all over TV telling people how to win. But they lost- don't know how to win!

Mitt Romney was a disaster candidate who had no guts and choked! Romney is a total joke and everyone knows it!

Thank you Kansas! The line going into the Orlando event is over a mile long. Massive crowd expected. Leaving Kansas now be there soon!

#CaucusForTrump #Trump2016  

Getting ready to make my speech at #KansasCaucus. A great honor! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016

Thank you Kansas! Thousands of people inside- and thousands outside who couldn't get into the hall. Really amazing! #CaucusForTrump

To the people of Kentucky  Rand Paul didn't want you. Now he runs back due to his presidential failure.  #VoteTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Why would anyone in Kentucky listen to failed presidential candidate Rand Paul re: caucus. Made a fool of himself (1%.) KY his 2nd choice! Wow big lines in Kansas.

For all of today's voters please remember that I am the only candidate that is self funding my campaign I am not bought and paid for!

Great time last night in Louisiana. Big and energetic crowd. Go out and vote now polls open. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I am in Kansas. Will be an exciting day. Big speech this morning in Wichita and then go to caucus. Sorry CPAC (the format was fine!). 

U.S. Senator Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) issued the following statement today regarding the 2016 presidential election: 

Mary Kissel is an SNL character right? She's not a real person right? #MorningJoe"  She is a major loser. No clue!

The Better Business Bureau report with an A rating for Trump University. #GOPDebate 

Rubio puts out ad that my pilot was a drug dealer- not true not my pilot! Guy owned helicopter company- don't think I ever even used.

Senator Sessions will serve as the  Chairman of my National Security  Advisory Committee. 

People are just mad that you're doing so good so they are gonna do they're best to stop you. Not gonna happen #MAGA. Now Romney wants to do it again.

The phony lawsuit against Trump U could have been easily settled by me but I want  to go to court. 98% approval rating by students. Easy win

As predicted Trump reaching out to make peace with Republican "establishment".  If he becomes inevitable party would be

Why did Mitt Romney BEG me for my endorsement four years ago?

I am the only one who can beat Hillary Clinton. I am not a Mitt Romney who doesn't know how to win. Hillary wants no part of "Trump

Why would the great people of Florida vote for a guy who as a Senator never even shows up to vote - worst record. Marco Rubio is a joke!

I have brought millions of people into the Republican Party while the Dems are going down. Establishment wants to kill this movement!

Failed candidate Mitt Romneywho ran one of the worst races in presidential historyis working with the establishment to bury a big "R" win!

Looks like two-time failed candidate Mitt Romney is going to be telling Republicans how to get elected. Not a good messenger!

Millions of dollars being spent on false TV ads by special interest groups who own Rubio & Cruz.When you see them think of your puppet POLS

The establishment doesn't like me because they can't control me and get me to lie to you and keep ripping you off.

Because of me the Republican Party has taken in millions of new voters a record. If they are not careful they will all leave. Sad! I would love to see the Republican party and everyone get together- and unify.

Just another desperate move by the man who should have easily beaten Barrack Obama.

Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney is having a news conference tomorrow to criticize me. 

I am going to repeal and replace ObamaCare! Read more about my positions on healthcare reform here. Fox muppets!

CNN poll just hit 49% for Trump. Interesting how my numbers have gone so far up since lightweight Marco Rubio has turned nasty. Love it!

And you and the rest of you Fox muppets refuse to HEAR HIM.

Why can't the leaders of the Republican Party see that I am bringing in new voters by the millions-we are creating a larger stronger party! My wife MELANIA TRUMP! I took Trump University class and saved my home!

Marco Rubio lost big last night. I even beat him in Virginia where he spent so much time and money. Now his bosses are desperate and angry!

Why would anyone in Florida vote for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. Check out his credit card scam his house sale & his no show voting!

The special interests and people who control our politicians (puppets) are spending $25 million on misleading and fraudulent T.V. ads on me.

Got the endorsement of Brian France and NASCAR yesterday in Georgia. Also many of the sports great drivers. Thank you Nascar and Georgia!

Governor Alejandro Garc\xc3\xada Padilla said presidential hopeful Sen. Marco Rubio is no friend of Puerto Rico." 

I am self funding my campaign and only work for YOU the American people! Hillary could lose to Trump in Democratic New York. My sons Don and Eric! My sons Don and Eric! My sons Don and Eric!
Thank you. 32000 supporters tonight. Get out & VOTE on Tuesday! WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Our law enforcement officers deserve our appreciation for the incredible job they do. Video: 

I will be making a big surprise announcement to the massive crowd assembled in Huntsville/Madison Alabama! Landing now! #Trump2016

Phylis Schlafly: 'Marco Rubio Betrayed Us All' 

Little Marco Rubio treated America's ICE officers "like absolute trash" in order to pass Obama's amnesty. 

Little Marco Rubio gave amnesty to criminal aliens guilty of "sex offenses." DISGRACE! 

Little Marco Rubio is just another Washington D.C. politician that is all talk and no action. #RobotRubio 

Rubio was kicking back on his $80k boat he bought with lobbyist money and claimed it was from book sale profit lol

Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio is polling very poorly in Florida. The people can't stand him for missing so many votes - poor work ethic!

Little Marco Rubio the lightweight no show Senator from Florida is just another Washington politician. 

Mitt Romney didn't show his tax return until SEPTEMBER 212012 and then only after being humiliated by Harry R! A bad messenger for estab!

As I stated at the press conference on Friday regarding David Duke- I disavow. 

Why would the people of Texas support Ted Cruz when he has accomplished absolutely nothing for them. He is another all talk no action pol!

Little Marco Rubio the lightweight no show Senator from Florida is set to be the "puppet" of the special interest Koch brothers. WATCH!

Making a big speech in Alabama today. So many people we had to move to a football stadium! Come and join us!

I am the only Republican who will get large numbers of Dems and Indies (crossover). I will also get states that no other Republican can get.

While Hillary and I both won South Carolina by big margins Repubs got far more votes with a massive increase from past cycles.GROWING PARTY

The Republican Establishment has been pushing for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio to say anything to "hit" Trump.I signed the pledge-careful

While I hear the Koch brothers are in big financial trouble (oil) word is they have chosen little Marco Rubio the lightweight from Florida. A lot more water after this bombshell Rubio. You are an enemy of America.

It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep. It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.
It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.

It is a sad commentary little boy Marco Rubio can't win in his home state. Floridians despise him as a opportunist phony.

We need to fix our broken education system! #StopCommonCore RogerStone was just banned by CNN - their loss! Tough loyal guy.

I started my business with very little and built it into a great company with some of the best real estate assets in the World. Amazing!

I only wish my wonderful father Fred gave me $200 million to start my business like lightweight Rubio says. He didn't - total fabrication!

Fun to watch the Democrats working so hard to win the great State of South Carolina when I just won the Republican version - amazing people!

I am self-funding my campaign and am therefore not controlled by the lobbyists and special interests like lightweight Rubio or Ted Cruz!

Tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit. After the audit no problem!

I unfairly get audited by the I.R.S. almost every single year. I have rich friends who never get audited. I wonder why?

A majority of evangelicals believe I am best equipped to save the country. #Greta

What I would do on my first day in office. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Never let them see you sweat! 

They don't like Rubio in Florida- he left them high and dry. Doesn't even show up for votes!

Lightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night. The problem is he is a choker and once a choker always a choker! Mr. Meltdown.

Wow every poll said I won the debate last night. Great honor!

Lightweight choker Marco Rubio looks like a little boy on stage. Not presidential material!

Lying Ted Cruz and lightweight choker  Marco Rubio teamed up last night in a last ditch effort to stop our great movement. They failed!

Will be at Fort Worth (Texas) Convention Center at 11:30 A.M. Big crowd - get there early! Big announcement to be made!

Why would the people of Florida vote for Marco Rubio when he defrauded them by agreeing to represent them as their Senator and then quit!

Have a good chance to win Texas on Tuesday. Cruz is a nasty guy not one Senate endorsement and despite talk gets nothing done. Loser!

I will be making a speech at 12:00 in Fort Worth Texas. Really big crowd expected. Will be talking about the debate last night-plus plus!

Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney was made to look like a fool by Senator Harry Reid & didn't release his tax returns.

FMR PRES of Mexico Vicente Fox horribly used the F word when discussing the wall. He must apologize! If I did that there would be a uproar!

Early on Ted Cruz said that if he didn't win South Carolina it's over. He didn't win- and lost to me in a landslide! Signing a recent tax return- isn't this ridiculous? 

Just for your info tax returns have 0 to do w/ someones net worth. I have already filed my financial statements w/ FEC. They are great!

Why doesnt Mitt Romney just endorse Marco Rubio already. Should have done it before NH or Nevada where he had a little sway. Too late now!

Mitt Romney who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics is now pushing me on tax returns. Dope!

Great new poll. Thank you Texas! #VoteTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

Ted Cruz is lying again. Polls are showing that I do beat Hillary Clinton head to head.

That's why we are angry. The Republican Establishment will not support you. You are who the American people want!

This Texan will be voting Trump March 1st. Cruz is a fake Texan!

Chris thank you so much for your wonderful endorsement. I will not let you down! 

When Ted Cruz quits the race and the field begins to clear I will get most of his votes - no problem!

Why would Texans vote for "liar" Ted Cruz when he was born in Canada lived there for 4 years-and remained a Canadian citizen until recently

When Mitt Romney asked me for my endorsement last time around he was so awkward and goofy that we all should have known he could not win! He's a fool!

Mitt Romney who totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool is now playing tough guy. He's a fool!

The polls show that I picked up many Jeb Bush supporters. That is how I got to 46%. When others drop out I will pick up more.  Sad but true. He's a fool! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

In all of television- the only one who said anything bad about last nights landslide victory-- was dopey @KarlRove. He should be fired!

I am self funding my campaign & don't owe anybody anything! I only owe it to the American people! 

I beat both Hillary and Bernie and I haven't even started on them yet!

MELANIA TRUMP did great on television this morning. Poised smart and strong with a big heart - so much to offer. We are all proud of you! 

Make sure you get on the Trump line and are not mislead by the Cruz people. They are bad! BE CAREFUL.

Very proud of what my father has accomplished in the past 7 months -Wishing him amazing luck and success tonight! #NVcaucus 

My wife Melania will be on Morning Joe tomorrow morning at 8:00.  

Club for Growth is the group that came to my office seeking $1 million dollars. I told them no and now they are doing negative ads.

Great. Just reported on Fox News that many people who supported JebBush are now supporting me. I knew that would happen pundits didn't!

Wow great Ohio poll. Shows me leading by 5 points beating K!

Unlike the other Republican candidates I will be in Nevada all day and night - I won't be fleeing in and out. I love & invest in Nevada!

I am growing the Republican Party tremendously - just look at the numbers way up! Democrats numbers are significantly down from years past.

TRUMP IS UNSTOPPABLE....HE IS WHAT COMMON SENSE AMERICANS WANT WHETHER REPUBLICAN INDEPENDENT OR A REAGAN DEMOCRAT.

Ed Rollins gets it. Was just on Fox News explaining how Trump wins the general election. Thank you Ed!

Ted Cruz lifts the Bible high into the air and then lies like a dog-over and over again! The Evangelicals in S.C. figured him out & said no!

Ted Cruz does not have the right "temperment" to be President. Look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm. BAD!

Wow was Ted Cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication. He used him as a scape goat-fired like a dog! Ted panicked.

Ted Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in S.C. He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration.

A big fat hit job on CNN tonight. A total waste of time to watch boring and biased. Said I would never run a dope!

Just watched the very incompetent Mitt Romney Campaign Strategist Stuart Stevens. Now I know why Mitt lost so badly. Stevens is a clown!

Ted Cruz should be disqualified from his fraudulent win in Iowa. Weak RNC and Republican leadership probably won't let this happen! Sad.

Just saw the phony ad by Cruz - totally false more dirty tricks. He got caught in so many lies - is this man crazy?

Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks. No wonder he has lost Evangelical support!

Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false - no basis in fact. Take ad down Ted. Biggest liar in politics!

Wow Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director. More dirty tricks!

It is so important to audit The Federal Reserve and yet Ted Cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done.

Thank you for your endorsement @paulteutulsr! #BikersForTrump #VoteTrumpNV Video: 

Many people are now saying I won South Carolina because of the last debate. I showed anger and the people of our country are very angry!

Florida starts early voting on March 5 extending to March 15. Absentee ballots have been sent out!

No matter what liar sleazeball says about Lyin Cruz in Tennessee. We have early voting.

I hear the Rickets family who own the Chicago Cubs are secretly spending $'s against me. They better be careful they have a lot to hide!

The reason that Ted Cruz lost the Evangelicals in S.C. is because he is a world class LIAR and Evangelicals do not like liars!

I am in Las Vegas at the best hotel (by far) Trump International. I will be working with my wonderful teams and volunteers to WIN Nevada!

A number of months ago I was not expected to win South CarolinaTed Cruz was and yet I won in a landslide - every group and category. WIN!

Just back from a dinner in West Hollywood: shocked the majority of the table was voting for Trump.

The failing WSJ Wall Street Journal should fire both its pollster and its Editorial Board. Seldom has a paper been so wrong.Totally biased!

I will be live on all of the major morning talk shows. Enjoy!

What a great night. Thank you South Carolina a special place with truly amazing people! LOVE

People gave me no chance in South Carolina. Now it looks like a possible win. I would be happy with a one vote victory! (HOPE)

South Carolina voters have the future of our country in their hands. Vote now (today) and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Remember that Marco Rubio is very weak on illegal immigration. South Carolina needs strength as illegals and Syrians pour in. Don't allow it

I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go!

Trump expressed concerns months after the Iraq War began while 60% of Americans still supported the war. 
TheTrump phenomenon summed up: Leadership Fighter and Winner. Not a Liar 

I am the only candidate (in many years) who is self-funding his campaign. Lobbyists and $ interests totally control all other candidates! 
TheTrump phenomenon summed up: Leadership Fighter and Winner. Not a Liar 

FoxNews is really starting to campaign hard for marcorubio. #fairandbalancedmyass"  He is weak on illegal immigration!

TheTrump phenomenon summed up: Leadership Fighter and Winner. Not a Liar 

Lying #Ted Cruz just (on election day) came out with a sneak and sleazy Robocall. He holds up the Bible but in fact is a true lowlife pol!

I'm a Regan Dem and believe in your message! God bless you and your campaign!

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Just finished two major speeches in South Carolina. Big crowds great people. Going for a third now!

Boycott all Apple products  until such time as Apple gives cellphone info to authorities regarding radical Islamic terrorist couple from Cal

Hopefully others will follow suit. Our country needs & should demand security. It is time to get tough & be smart!

I use both iPhone & Samsung. If Apple doesn't give info to authorities on the terrorists I'll only be using Samsung until they give info.

I have built so many great & complicated projects creating tens of thousands of jobs-video: 

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016  

Remember Cruz and Bush gave us Roberts who upheld #ObamaCare twice! I am the only one who will #MAKEAMERICAGREATAGAIN!

Im self-funding and I am going to take care of the people  not the special interests and insurance companies like the other candidates.

I will replace it with private plans health savings accounts & allow purchasing across state lines. Maximum choice & freedom for consumer.

I was referring to a backstop for pre-existing conditions. I will eliminate the law in its entirety & replace it w/ something much better. I agree with Marco Rubio that Ted Cruz is a liar!

I was asked about healthcare by Anderson Cooper & have been consistent- I will repeal all of #ObamaCare including the mandate period.

I agree with Marco Rubio that Ted Cruz is a liar!

.@FoxNews is changing their  theme from "fair and balanced" to "unfair and unbalanced." But dying @WSJ is worse.Their phony poll is a  joke!

New CBS National Poll just out - massive lead for Trump. The Wall Street Journal/NBC Poll is a total joke. No wonder WSJ is doing so badly!

I love being in South Carolina. We are leading big in all of the State polls - Saturday is a BIG day. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

The just out USA Today National Poll where I lead by big numbers shows that in a head to head matchup I beat both Hillary and Bernie.

Amazing that while I lead by big numbers in the new Q and and USA Today polls the the press only wants to report on the phony WSJ/NBC poll.

Jeb Bush just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses. He wants to look cool but it's far too late. 1% in Nevada!

Just out Nevada poll shows Jeb Bush at 1% he should take his dumb mouthpiece @LindseyGrahamSC and just go home.

FoxNews is so biased it is disgusting. They do not want Trump to win. All negative!

I will beat Hillary easily but Lindsey Graham says I won't and yet he got zero against me- no cred! Why does FOX put him on?

He had zero in his presidential run before dropping out in disgrace- saying the most horrible things about me on FoxNews.

Interesting how President Obama so haltingly said I "would never be president" - This from perhaps the worst president in U.S. history!

Why does Megan Kelly devote so much time on her shows to me almost always negative?  Without me her ratings would tank. Get a life Megyn!

Explain to Megan Kelly who know nothing that I will beat Hillary and win states (and dem-indie votes) that no other can!

Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

New PPP Poll just out - Trump up big Cruz Rubio and Bush down. The debate results even with a stacked RNC audience were wonderful!

Spent the full day at meetings and a major rally yesterday in South Carolina. Great people and spirit. Today will be more of the same.

New South Carolina poll from PPP. Thank you! #VoteTrumpSC 

What a night! 10000 amazing supporters in Greenville South Carolina! THANK YOU! VOTE on Saturday! #VoteTrumpSC 

Thank you for your continued support! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

RESPONSE TO THE LIES OF SENATOR CRUZ: 

JEB is a hypocrite! Used massive private "Eminent Domain" --- Just another clueless politician!  

Jeb used Eminent Domain & took advantage of a disabled vet in the process. (2/2) 

I'd like to call JEB a liar but the truth is he has no clue & never revealed that he used Eminent Domain- when criticizing me! 

Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb(!) is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center Iraq War and eco collapse? Careful!

I will be in South Carolina all week. Saturday is BIG BIG BIG! Get out and vote - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates Hillary would destroy them. Ted may not be eligible to run - born in Canada

Funny that Jeb(!) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.Then mommy now brother! Thank you! I miss my father. 

Ted Cruz along with Jeb Bush pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court. Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice but didn't!

Wow in the new CBS Poll I went way up into the forties! Thank you!

Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists & special interests - the bosses!

Loved the debate last night and almost everyone said I won but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution. All donors & special ints

Thank you for your support! TOGETHER we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Thank you! I miss my father. 

I will be on Face the Nation with John Dickerson on CBS this morning. Enjoy! Thank you! I miss my father. 

This shows what a complete & total liar Ted Cruz is- he said he wouldn't have nominated John Roberts. Really? 

Jeb is incompetent and will lose don't waste your energy on that cry baby!

Jeb is incompetent and will lose don't waste your energy on that cry baby!

Jeb is incompetent and will lose don't waste your energy on that cry baby!

Jeb is incompetent and will lose don't waste your energy on that cry baby! Thank you! I miss my father. 

Even though every poll Time Drudge etc. has me winning the debate by a lot FoxNews only puts negative people on. Biased - a total joke! Thank you! I miss my father. 

Crushed the debate! Thank you! Thank you! I miss my father. 

Hey Glenn Beck. See how I beat your boy Ted- in your own Blaze poll? Your endorsement means nothing! 

All polls have me winning debate big- Drudge TIME etc. Dopey Charles Krauthammer still nasty. He has zero cred- totally dishonest!

How can Jeb Bush beat Hillary Clinton- if he can't beat anyone else on the GOPDebate stage with $150M? I am the only one who can! Thank you! I miss my father.  

Lightweight @JebBush said tonight he didn't know his family used private eminent domain in Texas- Lie!  #GOPDebate

On the way to the #GOPDebate with my wonderful wife @MelaniaTrump. 

Ted Cruz is a cheater! He holds the Bible high and then lies and misrepresents the facts!

Nasty Ted Cruz is at it again- same dirty tricks he used w/ @RealBenCarson- saying I may not be on ballot & I hold liberal positions. LIES!

Wow! Honored to be chosen by the highly respected + accurate Washington & Lee Mock Convention. I hope you are right - I will make you proud!

The totally unexpected loss of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is a massive setback for the Conservative movement and our COUNTRY!

Love the people of South Carolina - look very much forward to the debate tonight.

@AmFree: #Trump On #Ford #Carrier Shipping #Jobs To #Mexico: Im The Only One Who Understands Whats Going On 

@ThtsWhtKelSaid: I'm fed up w/ DC playing 3 card Monty w/ our tax $'s. It's time we the people play the Trump card & take back our country

@BrandonSawyer84: @realDonaldTrump will rule #SouthCarolinaPrimary! 

@wino911:  #Trump2016 We know better than to trust the RNC 

RT @EricTrump: Nevada: Reminder that today is the LAST day to register to vote in the February 23rd caucus!

Thank you South Carolina! We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN! 

Get on Trump's List" email from the RNC was not authorized. I am self funding my campaign! Do not pay.  Email: 

A very big thank you to Bill Donohue head of The Catholic League for the wonderful interview on @CNN and article in Newsmax! Great insight

Totally unauthorized do not pay. I am self funding my campaign! Notice has just been withdrawn. #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

The RNC which is probably not on my side just illegally put out a fundraising notice saying Trump wants you to contribute to the RNC.

Now an additional 600-700 jobs in America (2000) being eliminated for move to Mexico- via Hartford Courant. 

Nice column by Bill Donahue head of Catholic League. He's a blue collar New Yorker and gets it 

I am the only one who can fix this. Very sad. Will not happen under my watch! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  

Just got back from Tampa. It was an amazing evening with an even more amazing crowd - fantastic people! Will be in South Carolina tomorrow.

Word is that little Morty Zuckermans @NYDailyNews loses more than $50 million per year---can that be possible?

When little Morty Zuckerman closes his failing @NYDailyNews will I at least be given some credit? Will happen soon.

11000 inside venue tonight in Tampa! Broke record set by Elton John in 1988 w/out musical instruments! Another 5000 outside. Will be back!

I will end illegal immigration and protect our borders! We need to MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN! #Trump2016 

Millions of $'s of false ads  paid for by lobbyists-special interests of cheater @SenTedCruz  and sleepy @JebBush are now running in S.C.


Last time lightweight @JebBush tried to knock off @marcorubio he made a total fool of himself. If he doesn't do better this time he is out!

If TedCruz doesnt clean up his act stop cheating & doing negative ads I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen.

Lightweight JebBush is spending a fortune of special interest against me in SC. False advertising- desperate and sad!

After hearing the news that they would not be able to extort $1M from me they went hostile w/ a series of incorrect & ill-informed ads.

Nothing conservative about the Club for Growth coming into my office and demanding a $1M contribution which naturally they did not get.

You must be registered Republican by February 16th to vote TRUMP in the Florida primary. 

The failing NYDailyNews destroyed by little Morty Zuckerman is preparing to close and save face by going online. It's dead!

NEVADA! Tomorrow is the deadline to register Republican.  Visit: 

How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?

Lying Cruz put out a statement Trump & Rubio are w/Obama on gay marriage." Cruz is the worst liar crazy or very dishonest. Perhaps all 3?

Weak JEB getting thrown out by management during speech. Do you think he will be this tough on Putin & others?  

THANK YOU- Baton Rouge Louisiana! WE will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! #Trump2016 

Just landed in Baton Rouge Louisiana. Reports are out that lines are three quarters of a mile to get in. Wow! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Cruz caught cold in lie after denial of push polls like lies w/ RealBenCarson. How can he preach Christian values? 

Heading to Baton Rouge Louisiana for a speech. Expecting a very large crowd! See you soon. #Trump2016  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

We are getting reports from many voters that the Cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest "pushpolls" on me. We are watching!

Jeb failed as Jeb! He gave up and enlisted Mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of Iraq). Spent $120 million.Weak-no chance!

He (or she) who hesitates is lost: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Remember it was the Republican Party with the help of Conservatives that made so many promises to their base BUT DIDN'T KEEP THEM! Hi DT

Mark Halperin showed a focus group on Morning Joe me using a very bad word. I never said the word left an open blank. Please apologize!

Jeb Bush spent more than $400000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5 I spent $30000 to come in 1st. Big difference in capability!

There are no buyers for the worthless @NYDailyNews but little Mort Zuckerman is frantically looking. It is bleeding red ink - a total loser!

I have been consistent in my opposition to Common Core. Get rid of Common Core--- keep education local! I was referring to the fact that Jeb Bush wants to keep common core.

So funny Jeb Bush called me a "highly gifted politician and a great entertainer" - I assume that is a compliment!

Such a great experience in New Hampshire - amazing people! Will be leaving for a big event in South Carolina today.

Like the worthless NYDailyNews looks like Politico will be going out of business. Bad reporting- no money no cred!

Worthless NYDailyNews which dopey Mort Zuckerman is desperately trying to sell has no buyer! Liabilities are massive!

Dopey Mort Zuckerman owner of the worthless @NYDailyNews has a major inferiority complex. Paper will close soon!

My report card grades for the 2 New Hampshire winners: DonaldTrump A: v strong energy/close. BernieSanders B+: went too long

Thank you to the people of  New Hampshire I love you! Now off to South Carolina.

We will stop heroin and other drugs from coming into New Hampshire from our open southern border. We will build a WALL and have security.

We will immediately repeal and replace ObamaCare - and nobody can do that like me. We will save $'s and have much better healthcare!

ISIS is making big threats today - no respect for U.S.A. or our "leader" - If I win it will be a very different storywith very fast results

The polls are now showing that I am the best to win the GENERAL ELECTION. States that are never in play for Repubs will be won by me. Great!

No-one has done more for people with disabilities than me. I have spent many millions of dollars to help out-and am happy to have done so!

I know the "Governors" and Jeb Bush who has gone nasty with lies is by far the weakest of the lot. His family used private eminent domain!

Remember @JebBush wants COMMON CORE (education from D.C.) and is very weak on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ("come as act of love"). Not a leader!

Now that Bush has wasted $120 million of special interest money on his failed campaign he says he would end super PACs. Sad!

Today's third stop- Londonderry New Hampshire! Thank you! #FITN #VoteTrumpNH 

America needs strong leadership. Politicians can talk but they dont get things done. Video: 

Everybody is laughing at Jeb Bush-spent $100 million and is at bottom of pack. A pathetic figure!

Jeb Bush is desperate - strongly in favor of #CommonCore and very weak on illegal immigration.

Thank you for your support at this mornings Town Hall- in Salem New Hampshire. #FITN #NHPrimary 

Jeb Bush has zero communication skills so he spent a fortune of special interest money on a Super Bowl ad. He is a weak candidate!

My two wonderful sons Don and Eric will be on @foxandfriends at 7:02 - now! Enjoy.

So far the Super Bowl is very boring - not nearly as exciting as politics - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I am in New Hampshire having a great time! Loved the #GOPDebate last night! Everybody enjoy the Super Bowl. #SuperBowlSunday #SB50

Thank you- Plymouth New Hampshire! #FITN #NHPrimary 

Thank you Newt!  

We are going to have a big event at the Verizon Wireless Arena in Manchester New Hampshire! 5K+! Join us tomorrow: 

Great to meet everyone while having breakfast @ChezVachon this morning! 

Trump Kasich Jeb and Christie all had good nights. 

The New Hampshire drug epidemic must stop. If elected POTUS- I will create borders & the drugs will stop pouring in. 

Border agent: "We might as well abolish our immigration laws altogether" 

I said this was happening long ago- I will stop this immediately!  

It never ends!  

I told you so. Our country totally lost control of illegal immigration even with criminals.  

10000 people in South Carolina unbelievable evening! Will be in New Hampshire tomorrow- love it. 

Really dumb Cheri Jacobus. Begged my people for a job. Turned her down twice and she went hostile. Major loser zero credibility!

Donald Trump loves America! He loves Americans! He loves our Vets! #TrumpSupporters 

Watch: Donald Trump OWNS A Heckler Who Said Illegal Immigrants Are The Backbone Of America 

Why vote for Trump? Unlike politicians all talk Trumps talk materializes! He will make America great again

Join me at Clemson University on Wednesday February 10th! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

Heading to South Carolina really big crowd! Will be back in New Hampshire tomorrow. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Such great support in New Hampshire. So many people are working so hard to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!

I very much look forward to tomorrows debate in New Hampshireso many things to say so much at stake. It will be an incredible evening!

Live Free or Die: A motto for the whole country to follow. #NewHampshire #FITN #VoteTrumpNH  

Big storm in New Hampshire. Moved my event to Monday. Will be there next four days.

Join us Monday February 8th @ the Verizon Wireless Arena in Manchester New Hampshire! #FITN #NHPolitics #Trump2016 

I agree. Great businessman. I like your tone tonight! Keep it up & you'll have this Democrats vote.

I will be interviewed by Anderson Cooper at 8pm on @CNN from New Hampshire. Should be very interesting!

Taking a helicopter to New Hampshire boarding now. Amazing activity planned. New UMASS poll very nice! 

Politicians are trying to chip away at the 2nd Amendment. I wont let them take away our guns! #Trump2016 Watch: 

This is the Cruz voter violation certificate sent to everyone a misdemeanor at minimum. 

As per the show an even more serious Cruz charge is the fraudulent voter violation certificate sent to everyone.


Thank you. Ted Cruz should be immediately disqualified in Iowa with each candidate moving up one notch.

Sanders says he wants to run against me because he doesn't want to run against me. He would be so easy to beat!

THANK YOU to everyone in Little Rock Arkansas tonight! A record crowd of 12K. #Trump2016 

Stop the assault on American values. Stand w/ Trump to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! #VotersSpeak: 

Thank you New Hampshire! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #FITN 

Dr. Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for "deceit and dirty tricks and lies.

Cruz just lied again- I am and have been totally against #ObamaCare- repeal and replace!

The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!

This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #CruzFraud 

I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! @FoxNews

Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.

And finally Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie!

The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud

Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.

During primetime of the Iowa Caucus Cruz put out a release that RealBenCarson was quitting the race and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.

Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!

Great job on Don Lemon tonight. Begged us for a job. We said no and she went hostile. A real dummy! CNN

On my way to New Hampshire- expecting a big and spirited crowd!  #FITN #Trump2016  

Anybody who watched all of Ted Cruz's far too long rambling overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his Howard Dean moment!

The #CruzCrew prevailed! Smart for @MarcoRubio to keep his speech short & sweet. Ditto for @realDonaldTrump who was brie

I don't believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign the only one. I will keep doing but not worth it!

I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in New Hampshire. Big crowd

The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history!

Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz & Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honor

My experience in Iowa was a great one. I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place. Nice

So nice to get an endorsement from the founder and owner of Pizza Ranch in Iowa! A great guy and great places! #CaucusForTrump

It is time to take back our country- and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! #CaucusForTrump Video: 

I will be interviewed on Face The Nation with @jdickerson this morning. Enjoy!

I am in Iowa. Will be interviewed on This Week With G Stephanopoulos this morning. ENJOY!

If I would have done the last debate a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). Also VETS got $600

By not doing the failed poorly rated debate I was able to make the point of not allowing "unfairness" - while raising $60000 for VETS.

Wow just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me will repeal & replace. He lies!

Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans scam!

Ted Cruz is totally unelectable if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN!

I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife Melania. After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State!

The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters "in violation." They are now under investigation. Bad!

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  #IACaucus #CaucusForTrump 

#IACaucus #CaucusForTrump #iCaucused #iVoted 

I want to thank evangelical Christians for the warm embrace I've received on the campaign trail. Video: 

I will be in Iowa all day and until Tuesday morning. Finally after all these years of watching stupidity we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Hillary Clinton is a major national security risk. Not presidential material! 

Amazing that Ted Cruz can't even get a Senator like @BenSasse who is easy to endorse him. Not one Senator  is endorsing Canada Ted!

The great State of Nebraska can do much better than @BenSasse as your Senator. Saw him on @greta - totally ineffective. Wants paid for pols.

The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton. At a minimum how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president?

They say that if I participated in last nights Fox debate they would have had 12 million more & would have broken the all time record.

Getting ready to take off for Nashua New Hampshire. Big crowd will be there soon. Fun!

Iowa was amazing last night. The event could not have worked out better. We raised $60000 for our great vets. They were so happy & proud

Thank you for your interest & support during last nights #GOPDebate! #IACaucus finder: 

Good morning America! Thank you for all of your support in the latest Drudge poll! 

Thank you for the kind words tonight @OMAROSA. You were great! See you soon!

I will take care of the Veterans who have served this country so bravely. #ThankAVet Video: 

An unbelievable night in Iowa with our great Veterans! We raised $60000.00 while the politicians talked! #GOPDebate

Watching biased Charles @krauthammer a @FoxNews flunky who didn't know that I won every debate in particular- the last one. Check polls!

I hear that Lyin' Cruz's man Robert Mercer a good man is very angry because Cruz lied to him about liquidating his (Teds) holdings?

I just can't be bought!

The "debate" tonight will be a total disaster - low ratings with advertisers and advertising rates dropping like a rock. I hate to see this.

On Greta 87% of the people said they would not watch the debate if I'm not in it. Wow- what an honor!

FOX debate advertising rates falling like a rock! Tune into my special event for the Veterans at 9pm EST!

Thank you- Lexington South Carolina! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

It was the childishly written & taunting PR statement by Fox that made me not do the debate more so than lightweight reporter Megan Kelly.

I am self funding my campaign so I do not owe anything to lobbyists & special interests. Should I do the GOP debate? 

By not showing I'm owning entire event. 

Even though I beat him in the first six debates especially the last one Ted Cruz wants to debate me again. Can we do it in Canada?

Just got to listen to Rush Limbaugh - the guy is fantastic! Should I do the GOP debate? 

The statement put out yesterday by @FoxNews was a disgrace to good broadcasting and journalism. Who would ever say something so nasty & dumb. Should I do the GOP debate? 

I refuse to call Megyn Kelly a bimbo because that would not be politically correct. Instead I will only call her a lightweight reporter.

Pathetic attempt by Fox to try and build up ratings for the #GOPDebate. Without me they'd have no ratings!  

Should I do the GOP debate? 

Begged me to do an event while asking organizers for $100000 for himself a bad guy!

Great honor- Rev. Jerry Falwell Jr. of Liberty University one of the most respected religious leaders in our nation has just endorsed me! 

For the great people of Iowa find your IACaucus location.

Why doesn't phony  @bobvanderplaats tell his followers all the times he asked for him and his family to stay at my hotels-didn't like paying

I will end common core. It's a disaster. 

Donald Trump retains national lead in new ABC News/WaPo poll with 37%: 

Cruz lies are almost as bad as Jeb's. These politicians will do anything to stay at the trough!

Cruz going down fast in recent polls- dropping like a rock. Lies never work!

Ted Cruz is a nervous wreck. He is making reckless charges not caring for the truth! His poll #'s are way down!

I have a touched a nerve in our country in a way that most politicians have not been able to do. 

It's time for Ted Cruz to either settle his problem with the FACT that he was born in Canada and was a citizen of Canada or get out of race

Trump +15 on Cruz in 2 weeks. Cruz may look back and ask why he ever attacked Trump. DT has killed him ever since. Love making correct predictions. National Review is over.

Fox News Poll Thank you New Hampshire! #FITN #Trump2016 

Love making correct predictions. National Review is over. 

I will make our Military so big powerful & strong that no one will mess with us. #Trump2016 

I will be on Face The Nation this morning at various times across the U.S. CBSNews  Enjoy! Love making correct predictions. National Review is over.

I will be on ABC this morning at various times across the U.S. NBCNews  Enjoy!

Love making correct predictions. National Review is over.  

Word is that crying Glenn Beck left the GOP and doesn't have the right to vote in the Republican primary. Dumb as a rock.

Serious doubt in Illinois as to whether or not Cruz can run for President. First of many challenges. 

Just left a great event in Pella. Going to church tomorrow in Muscatine Iowa.

I will be on FOX with the great Judge Jeanine tonight at 9pm EST! Enjoy! #Trump2016

.@williebosshog such an honor to get your endorsement. You are a fantastic guy! It will not be forgotten. Don and Eric say hello!

Heading now to Pella Iowa. Big crowd! Remember Trump is a big buyer of Pella windows. See you soon!

For the great people of Iowa find your #IACaucus location at 

Just left Sioux Center Iowa. My speech was very well received. Truly great people! Packed house- overflow!

A wonderful story on Iowa voters by @arappeport of the @NYTimes.  

Failing Glenn Beck lost all credibility. Not only was he fired @ FOX he would have voted for Clinton over McCain. 

Based on Megyn Kelly's conflict of interest and bias she should not be allowed to be a moderator of the next debate.

Heading to Sioux County Iowa where the crowd is amazing. Dr. Robert Jeffress will make the introduction. Make America Great Again!

Ted Cruz poll numbers are down big. Because he was born in Canada and was until recently a Canadian citizen many believe he cannot run!

I am in Iowa watching all of these phony T.V. ads by the other candidates. All bull politicians are all talk and no action-it won't happen!

.@AnnCoulter has been amazing. We will win and establish strong borders we will build a WALL and Mexico will pay. We will be great again!

I will be the greatest job-producing president in American history. #Trump2016 #VoteTrump  

Dow down almost 2000 pts since start of year but still outperforming Wall Street's investment in Jeb. JEB wants Common Core

I am in Iowa. Will be making two speeches today. Good luck to all of the great folks on the East coast. Enjoy the beauty of the storm!

A wonderful article by a writer who truly gets it. I am for the people and the people are for me. #Trump2016  

Is Cruz honest? He is in bed w/ Wall St. & is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi low interest loans. No legal disclosure & never sold off assets.

Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for #POTUS. He could be Canadian Prime Minister.

Cruz says I supported TARP which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose. Puppet!

The only reason irrelevant @GlennBeck doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times. Very few listeners - sad!

One of the National Review lightweights came to my office begging for money like a dog. Why doesn't he say that?

Just watched Jeb's ad where he desperately needed mommy to help him. Jeb, Mom can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Ted Cruz went down big in just released Reuters poll - what's going on? Is it Goldman Sachs/Citi loans or Canada?

Rush Limbaugh is great tells it as he sees it---really honorable guy! Thanks Rush! #Trump2016

The tax scam Washington Post does among the most inaccurate stories of all. Really dishonest reporting.

Just received the new Fox poll. Thank you America! #Trump2016 

Wow! New National Zogby Poll just out:.TRUMP 45. CRUZ 13. RUBIO 8. Big numbers.

Leaving Nevada now for Iowa. Things are looking good - great new polls!

New Reuters poll! Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

The dying NRO National Review has totally given up the fight against Barrack Obama. They have been losing for years. I will beat Hillary!

Wow! This might be my highest numbers yet! Thank you to my opposition- you are totally ineffective & have been for years! 

I could've sworn I saw him outside Trump Tower the other day! 

@Lisa_Milicaj: Truth be told I  never heard of The National Review until they "tried" to declare war on you. No worries you got my vote!

After spending $89 million @JebBush is at the bottom of the barrel in polls. He is ashamed to use the name "Bush" in ads. Low energy guy!

The failing National Review Magazine has just been informed by the Republican National Committee that they cannot participate in debate

Ted Cruz complains about my views on eminent domain but without it we wouldn't have roads highways airports schools or even pipelines.

Make America Great Again! #Trump2016 

The late great William F. Buckley would be ashamed of what had happened to his prize the dying National Review!

Very few people read the National Review because it only knows how to criticize but not how to lead.

National Review is a failing publication that has lost it's way. It's circulation is way down w its influence being at an all time low. Sad!

Thank you Iowa! #FITN #IACaucus #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Why does Greta have a fired Bushy like dummy John Sununu on- spewing false info? I will beat Hillary by a lot she wants no part of Trump.

Happy birthday to my friend the great @jacknicklaus - a totally special guy!

New Day on CNN treats me very badly. @AlisynCamerota is a disaster. Not going to watch anymore.

Low energy candidate JebBush has wasted $80 million on his failed presidential campaign. Millions spent on me. He should go home and relax!

Sad sack JebBush has just done another ad on me with special interest money saying I won't beat Hillary - I WILL. But he can't beat me.

So sad that CNN and many others refused to show the massive crowd at the arena yesterday in Oklahoma. Dishonest reporting!

Wacko @glennbeck is a sad answer to the @SarahPalinUSA endorsement that Cruz so desperately wanted. Glenn is a failing crying lost soul!

Trump destroyed Hillary & Sanders moved in. But he didn't destroy her. Trump did. 

Palins brand among evangelicals is as gold as the faucets in Trump tower said Ralph Reed the chairman of the Faith & Freedom Coalition.

Wow the highly respected Governor of Iowa just stated that "Ted Cruz must be defeated." Big shoker! People do not like Ted.

A true honor to receive the endorsement of John Wayne's daughter....read: 

In the just released SC poll I increased my lead by 4 points since last poll by same firm. Up by 14! Cruz dropped 3. 

Thank you for your strong testimony when welcoming me to Liberty University yesterday- @JerryJrFalwell. 

Thank you Georgia! I appreciate all of your support. #Trump2016 

Just read your complete statement. You are an amazing guy & I really appreciate your words & support. I will see you soon!

On my way to Iowa- just received new national poll numbers. Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Really disgusting that the failing New York Times allows dishonest writers to totally fabricate stories.

Dope Frank Bruni said I called many people including Karl Rove losers-true! I never called my friend @HowardStern a loser- hes a winner!

Wow new polls just out have Trump up and Cruz down - he is a nervous wreck!

I don't think Ted Cruz can even run for President until he can assure Republican voters that being born in Canada is not a problem. Doubt!

Ted Cruz is falling in the polls. He is nervous. People are worried about his place of birth and his failure to report his loans from banks!

I loved being at Liberty University today! Record setting crowd unbelievable people! Thank you Jerry and Becki! 

We launched a new series of #Trump2016 videos via Facebook. A new topic everyday! Watch: 

A great morning with everyone @LibertyU! Thank you! Off to New Hampshire now. #Trump2016  

Leaving for Liberty University. I'll be speaking today in front of a record crowd. #Trump2016

Just a reminder that Ted Cruz supported liberal Justice John Roberts who gave us #Obamacare. 

Thank you @IvankaTrump for the kind words. I am very proud of the role model you are for so many. NH & IA radio ad: 

I am self-funding my campaign - putting up my own money not controlled.  Cruz is spending $millions on ads paid for by his N.Y. bosses.

Far more killed than anticipated in radical Islamic terror attack yesterday. Get tough and smart U.S. or we won't have a country anymore!

Big announcement in Ames Iowa on Tuesday! You will not want to miss this rally! #Trump2016 

Iran is going to buy 114 jetliners with a small part of the $150 billion we are giving them...but they won't buy from U.S. rather Airbus!

In Iran deal we get 4 prisoners. They get $150 billion 7 most wanted and many off watch list. This will create great incentive for others!

Interesting read from Peggy Noonan. 

Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about & demeaning? 

Wow! Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul & $1M low int. loan from Goldman Sachs. Hypocrite

Departing NH now- great morning with record crowd in Portsmouth- in a snow storm! Thank you! 

Greatly dishonest of Ted Cruz to file a financial disclosure form & not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St

When will Ted Cruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him.

Everybody that loves the people of New York and all they have been thru should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!

If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?

Ted is the ultimate hypocrite. Says one thing for money does another for votes.  

Great new numbers. Thank you!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Ted Cruz purposely and illegally did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!

Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?

Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.

The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there!

Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!

Ted Cruz said he ""didn't know"" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable

Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so

More radical Islam attacks today - it never ends! Strengthen the borders, we must be vigilant and smart. No more being politically correct.

Just got back from Iowa - had a great time with amazing people. Will be back soon!

Top searched candidate by state, as seen in the #GOPDebate media filing center. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Sen. Lindsey Graham embarrassed himself with his failed run for President and now further embarrasses himself with endorsement of Bush.

Jeb Bush, who did poorly last night in the debate and whose chances of winning are zero, just got Graham endorsement. Graham quit at O.

Do you think Iran would have acted so tough if they were Russian sailors? Our country was humiliated.

@Bonfiredesigns: Standing with @realDonaldTrump as he defends our sailors and military and Americans in the USA 

United States looks more and more like a paper tiger. Won't be that way if I win!

Iran humiliated the United States with the capture of our 10 sailors. Horrible pictures & images. We are weak. I will NOT forget!

Stuart Stevens is a dumb guy who fails @ virtually everything he touches. Romney campaign,his book,etc. Why does @andersoncooper put him on?

Why does @CNN & @andersoncooper waste airtime by putting failed campaign strategist, Stuart Stevens - who lost BIG for Romney - on the show?

Sadly, there is no way that Ted Cruz can continue running in the Republican Primary unless he can erase doubt on eligibility. Dems will sue!

Iran toys with U.S. days before we pay them, ridiculously, billions of dollars. Don't release money. We want our hostages back NOW!

Numerous polls have me beating Hillary Clinton. In a race with her, voter turnout will be the highest in U.S. history-I get most new voters!

The State Of The Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time. New leadership fast!

Just found out that @tedcruz is spending a fortune on Iowa push polls negative to me. Not nice, but OK! New polls are great.

The #SOTU speech is really boring, slow, lethargic - very hard to watch!

The Iran deal is terrible. Why didn't we get the uranium stockpile - it was sent to Russia. #SOTU

New CBS poll. #Trump2016 

Another new Iowa poll just released. Thank you! #IACaucus #FITN 

Such a serious problem for Ted & the GOP. Great doubt, Dems will sue! Let's all work together to solve this problem. 

On my way to Cedar Falls, Iowa, now. Will be great--I love the people of Iowa!

Fantastic job on @CNN  tonight. @kayleighmcenany is a winner! @donlemon

Megan Kelly recently said that she cant be wooed by Trump. She is so average in every way, who the hell wants to woo her!

So professional of ABC news to throw out the failing Union Leader newspaper from their debate. Paper won't survive, highly unethical!

Congratulations to my friend Sly Stallone on winning a GoldenG lobe. A wonderful guy- who has created something special, well deserved!

Why does Stephanopoulos allow a hater & racist like @tavissmiley to waste good airtime? ABC can do much better than him!

Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog. For starters, try getting a new publisher!

UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows. They aren't worthy of representing the great people NH.

This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed.

If their highly unethical behavior, including begging me for ads, isnt questionable enough, they have endorsed a candidate who cant win.

I am pleased to announce that I had the Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate. 

Remember, get TIME magazine! I am on the cover. Take it out in 4 years and read it again! Just watch...

Heading now for Reno, Nevada, for a big rally. Good poll numberd all over!

In the just out @FoxNews Poll, I easily beat Hillary Clinton - and I havn't even focused on her yet. On our way: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Yesterday in Iowa was amazing - two speeches in front of two great sold out crowds. They love that I am the only candidate self-funding!

@redletter99: Trump pummels his opponents - and the press | SunHerald @realDonaldTrump "

I want to thank the people of Iowa for an unbelievable day. The crowds were amazing. Will be back Tuesday!

Will be on Meet the Press with @ChuckTodd tomorrow morning. Enjoy!

I will be interviewed by Chris Wallace on Fox tomorrow morning. Tune in!

I'm protesting the @UnionLeader from having anything to do w/ ABC debate. Their unethical record doesn't give them the right to be involved!

David brilliantly tells it like it is -- the real deal! Read it!  

Time Magazine has me on the cover this week. David Von Drehle has written one of the best stories I have ever had.

Thank you so much. Earnest must have been a great person. 

Thank you. It is a true person of character that can change his opinion & do what is right. 

Constitutional law expert  #Laurence Tribe of Harvard says ""wrong to say it (natural born citizen) is a settled matter-it isn't settled).

South Carolina rally last night was so unbelievably exciting (and fun). I am now off to Iowa for two big rallies - packed houses. Love it!

Pat Buchanan gave a fantastic interview this morning on @CNN - way to go Pat, way ahead of your time!

Love seeing union & non-union members alike are defecting to Trump. I will create jobs like no one else. Their #Dem leaders cant compete!

I hope all workers demand that their @Teamsters reps endorse Donald J. Trump. Nobody knows jobs like I do! Dont let them sell you out!

On my way to South Carolina. Big Crowd--- look forward to it!

Not good news for Jeb Bush.

Not good news for Jeb Bush.

Not good news for Jeb Bush.

Not good news for Jeb Bush.

Not good news for Jeb Bush.  

Hank Greenberg, formerly of AIG, gave $10 million to the @JebBush campaign 3 months ago. He is not happy, a total waste of money!

Great time in Burlington, Vermont. Crowd was amazing.

We could only get a small fraction of this 25k crowd in. The movement to Make America Great Again is unbelievable! 

I'm leaving now for Burlington, Vermont. It will be wild!

Joy Behar, who was fired from her last show for lack of ratings, is even worse on @TheView. We love Barbara!

The The View ABC, once great when headed by Barbara Walters, is now in total freefall. Whoopi Goldberg is terrible. Very sad!

Hillary and her friends! 

Weak & ineffective JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. False advertising!

I have an idea for @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster. Try using your last name and don't be ashamed of it!

SenTedCruz Ted--free legal advice on how to pre-empt the Dems on citizen issue. Go to court now & seek Declaratory Judgment--you will win!

Massive crowd in VT tonight. Venue not big enough. Officials say NO to outside event and sound system. Arrive early!

Man shot inside Paris police station. Just announced that terror threat is at highest level. Germany is a total mess-big crime. GET SMART!

I will be in beautiful Burlington, Vermont, tonight for a rally. Will be great fun. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

It was a very wise move that Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship 18 months ago. Senator John McCain is certainly no friend of Ted!

Macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the S&P last year, plunging 46%. Very disloyal company. Another win for Trump! Boycott.

The failing UnionLeader newspaper in N.H. just sent The Trump Organization a letter asking that we take ads. How stupid, how desperate!

Do you believe that @UnionLeader in NH was demanding ads? Look at enclosed letter from them, just received: 

I will be on @wolfblitzer for a @CNNSitRoom interview today. Please join us 5PM ET.

Huge crowd expected tomorrow night! VT Police say first come, first serve. Arrive early!

Dont like SamuelLJacksons golf swing.  Not athletic. Ive won many club championships. Play him for charity!

I dont cheat at golf but @SamuelLJackson cheatswith his game he has no choiceand stop doing commercials!

HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my son, @EricTrump! Very proud of you! 

Germany is going through massive attacks to its people  by the migrants allowed to enter the country. New Years Eve was a disaster. THINK!

I dont know SamuelLJackson, to best of my knowledge haven't played golf w/him & think he does too many TV commercials boring. Not a fan.

Wow UnionLeader circulation in NH has dropped from 75,000 to around 10bad management. No wonder they begged me for ads.

The rally in Lowell, Massachusetts, was amazing. 10,000 people going wild. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Woody Johnson, owner of the NYJets, is @JebBushs finance chairman. If Woody wouldve been w/me, he wouldve been in the playoffs, at least!

I look forward to being in Lowell, Massachusetts, today. I hear a very big crowd is expected--we will have lots of fun!


By the way, Hillary & the MSM forgot to mention that Hillary is in the  Al-Shabaab terror video. 

The worst thing Hillary could do is have her husband campaign for her. Just watch.

Iran, with all of the money and all else given to them by Obama, has wanted a way to take over Saudi Arabia & their oil. THEY JUST FOUND IT!

Does anybody remember when Bill Clinton, in 2008, worked long and hard for Hillary? She LOST! Now Bill is at it again. Just watch.

Thank you for your support in Biloxi, MS! Let's ALL get out & VOTE in 2016, so we can #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 

Hillary said that guns don't keep you safe. If she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm!

Al-Shabbab, not ISIS, just made a video on me - they all will as front-runner & if I speak out against them, which I must. Hillary lied!

Just returned from Mississippi - a great evening.

Remember, I am self-funding my campaign, the only one in either party. I'm not controlled by lobbyists or special interests-only the U.S.A.!

When I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates, beware - the candidates are mere puppets $$$$!

I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women!

Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president. Jeb Bush is a low energy individual, but Hillary is not much better!

Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL, but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant!

Jeb Bush is a low energy ""stiff"" who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls. Has no chance!

Jeb Bush is a sad case. A total embarrassment to both himself and his family, he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads!

Massive crowds expected in Mississippi tomorrow night. Look forward to it! 

The person that Hillary Clinton least wants to run against is, by far, me. It will be the largest voter turnout ever - she will be swamped!

I have never been interested in politics but because of you I want to get my political science degree. #trump2016""  Great!

I will be going to Mississippi tomorrow night - hear the crowds are going to be massive! Look forward to it.

Well, the year has officially begun. I have many stops planned and will be working very hard to win so that we can turn our country around!

Happy New Year from #MarALago! Thank you to my great family for all of their support. HAPPY NEW YEAR & THANK YOU! 

I will be on FoxNews live,  with members of my family, at 11:50 P.M. We will ring in the New Year together! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I would like to wish everyone A HAPPY AND HEALTHY NEW YEAR. WE MUST ALL WORK TOGETHER TO, FINALLY, MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN AND GREAT AGAIN!

Do you believe that The State Department, on NEW YEAR'S EVE, just released more of Hillary's e-mails. They just want it all to end. BAD!

THANK YOU ILLINOIS! Let's not forget to get family & friends- out to VOTE IN 20

HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my son @DonaldJTrumpJr! Very proud of you! #TBT 

I would feel sorry for @JebBush and how badly he is doing with his campaign other than for the fact he took millions of $'s of hit ads on me

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

People ask "why do you tweet and re-tweet to millions about Jeb Bush when he is so low in the polls?" Because of his big $ hit ads on me!

Jeb Bush has spent  $630000 and is at the bottom of the polls. I have spent almost nothing and am at the top. WIN! 

A GREAT day in South Carolina. Record crowd and fantastic enthusiasm. This is now a movement to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I predict that dying @UnionLeader newspaper which has been run into the ground by publisher "Stinky" Joe McQuaid will be dead in 2 years!

A lovely letter from the daughter of the late great John Wayne. Our country could use a John Wayne right now. 

Great poll- thank you Nevada! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

I'm going to be live with @ericbolling and @kimguilfoyle to ring in the New Year 2016. Everybody should tune in to @foxnews tomorrow night!

I never thought I'd be saying this but I've really enjoyed  RichLowry on television lately and he was terrific.

The dying UnionLeader newspaper in NH is in turmoil over my comments about them- like a bully that got knocked out!

THANK YOU Council Bluffs Iowa! The silent majority is silent no more! #Trump2016 #FITN 

Joe McQuaid of the dying Union Leader wanted ads lunches donations speeches from me and tweets---very unethical.

The great people of New Hampshire who I love are not properly served by the dying Union Leader newspaper.

Shows how dumb Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) of the dying Union Leader is to put out the letter I wrote saying why I didn't do his failed debate!

I hope he does better for Rubio than he did at the #Benghazi hearings which were a total disaster for Republicans & America!

We need a real President! 

Looking forward to being in Council Bluffs Iowa later today. Despite weather rally is on -- will be fantastic! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!

So I have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place. Jeb Bush has spent $59 million & done. Run country my way!

My campaign for president is $350000 under budget I have spent very little (and am in 1st place).Now I will spend big in Iowa/N.H./S.C.

Minorities line up behind.....Donald Trump" #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

I will be interviewed on the @TODAYshow at 7:00 A.M. Talking about the state of the race for president and more. Enjoy!

Remember that Bill Clinton was brought in to help Hillary against Obama in 2008. He was terrible failed badly and was called a racist!

Thank you to a #Trump2016 supporter for this video of my campaign- over the past 6 months. Video: 

Strange but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes while he will double & triple them a disaster!

Wages in are country are too low good jobs are too few  and people have lost faith in our leaders.We need smart and strong leadership now!

Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone shipped to other countries. We now are part time sad! I WILL FIX!

The middle-class has worked so hard are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no  effective raise in years. BAD

If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband with his terrible record of women abuse while playing the women's card on me she's wrong!

Hopefully the Republican National Committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in Virginia's Republican Party. FAST!

Straighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late. Stupid!  RNC

BernieSanders-who blew his campaign when he gave Hillary a pass on her e-mail crime said that I feel wages in America are too high. Lie!

What's going on in VA? What's the GOP doing?  They will lose the state because of the RNC!

Why are JebBush flunkies Anna Navarro and SE Cupp two of the dumbest people in politics always on the CNN panels.

The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. The Dems LOVE IT! Be smart and win for a change!

R.P.Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. Will now not allow desperately needed new voters. Suicidal mistake. RNC MUST ACT NOW!

It begins Republican Party of Virginia controlled by the RNC is working hard to disallow independent unaffiliated and new voters. BAD!

I will do far more for women than Hillary and I will keep our country safe something which she will not be able to do-no strength/stamina!

Thank you! #Trump2016 

Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM so inappropriate!

If the insurance companies are making lots of money and the # of uninsured is still largeObamacare is a failure since so expensive

A new terror warning was issued for European cties. At what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart. Weak leaders!

Criminal deportations in the U.S. are the lowest number in many years. We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country. MUST CHANGE!

The Phoenix V.A. it has just been reported is in worse shape than ever before. The wait is horrendous and people are dying. I will fix it

The same people that said I wouldn't run or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%) now say I won't beat Hillary.

He is so dishonest in his reporting. And to think he was going off the air until I came along-no ratings. I will beat Hillary!

CNN just announced that TRUMP was #1 story of 2015. Totally meaningless however if we don't WIN IT ALL and Make America Great Again!

When will the Democrats and Hillary in particular say "we must build a wall a great wall and Mexico is going to pay for it?" Never!

Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A. That will stop I will fix this quickly!

Remember when failed candidate @JebBush said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE? He's spent $59 million and is at 3%.

We have many problems in our house (country!) and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now because of me starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!

She gets what is going on in politics and sees it very clearly. Have her on more!

Merry Christmas to all. Have a great day and have a really amazing year. Together we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It will be done!

Great job on CNN today. Very wise indeed!

Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video. Bad reporting. Perhaps @NBC will do better next year-but doubt it!

True a total distortion of the facts!

Very dishonest in not showing the new @CNN Poll where I am at 39% 21points higher than Cruz. Be honest Chuck!

Why isn't Chuck Todd using the much newer CNN Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older poll?

Wow because of the pressure put on by me ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It's about time!

Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton a totally flawed candidate and beating her soundly

Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing New York Times are totally in the Hillary circle of bias. Think about Bill!

Wow even lowly Rand Paul has just past @JebBush in the new @CNN Poll. Jeb is at 3% I'm at 39%. Stop throwing your money down the drain!

In the ridiculous Jeb Bush ad about me Jeb is speaking to me during the debate but doesn't allow my answer which destroys him - SO SAD!

Poor Jeb Bush spent $50 million on his campaign I spent almost nothing. He's bottom (and gone) I'm top (by a lot). That's what U.S. needs!

Hillary said "I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign." I deplore the death and destruction she caused-stupidity

Merry Christmas & Happy Holidays! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Hillary when you complain about "a penchant for sexism who are you referring to. I have great respect for women. BE CAREFUL!

It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media.  New @CNN Poll amazing in ALL categories. 21 pt. Lead

Why does FoxNews give KarlRove so much airtime. He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased. Still thinks Romney won. Unfair coverage of Trump

FoxNews treats me so badly. Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out CNN Poll. All negative!

The @washingtonpost, which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on #Amazon, today did a nasty cartoon attacking @tedcruz kids. Bad

The silent majority- is silent no more! Remember the importance of VOTING! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

The Hillary Clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic. Be careful Hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card.

Thank you America! Together- we will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 

Big news just out - NEW CNN POLL  TRUMP  39 and leads in every major category. Likeability way up. CRUZ 18  CARSON 10  RUBIO 10

We need a PRESIDENT with strength, stamina, heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again!

It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. Sad!

When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama, it meant got beaten badly. The media knows this. Often used word in politics! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Wow, new Reuters Poll just out. Big lead if you want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  TRUMP 37  CRUZ 11 This is at the top of Drudge!

For those on TV defending my use of the word "schlonged bc #MSM is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. Dishonest #MSM

Once again, MSM is dishonest. "Schlonged is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got "schlonged" that meant beaten badly.

Jeb's big ad buy against me, paid for by lobbyists, shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements. He is really pathetic!

Watching CNN and consider SE Cupp to be one of the least talented people on television. Boring and biased!

The Donald should've been named Man of the Year. He dominates the polls, news, talk shows & social media. MAGA!

Henry McMaster Lt. Governor of South Carolina who endorsed me beat failed @CNN announcer Bakari Sellers so badly. Funny!

Jeff Zucker failed @NBC and he is now failing CNN.

CNN is unwatchable. Their news on me is fiction. They are a disgrace to the broadcasting industry and an arm of the Clinton campaign.

The documentary of me that CNN just aired is a total waste of time. I don't even know many of the people who spoke about me. A joke!

Final poll results from NBC on last nights Commander-in-Chief Forum. Thank you! #ImWithYou #MAGA 

It wasn't Matt Lauer that hurt Hillary last night. It was her very dumb answer about emails & the veteran who said she should be in jail.

#AmericaFirst #ImWithYou

With Luis Mexico and the United States would have made wonderful deals together - where both Mexico and the US would have benefitted.

Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is highly respected by President Pe√±a Nieto.

Hillary Clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past. She is totally confused. Unfit to serve as #POTUS.

Hillary just gave a disastrous news conference on the tarmac to make up for poor performance last night. She's being decimated by the media!

Last nights winner was clear & it will be proven time & time again - lets #MAGA!! Lets WIN!! #TrumpTrain

A rough night for Hillary Clinton.

A rough night for Hillary Clinton.

Thank you to @foxandfriends for the nice reviews of last night.

Thank you America - great #CommanderInChiefForum polls!

Thank you Peter - if elected I will think big for our country & never let the American people down! #AmericaFirst

Message for undecided voters: Please wake up and vote DonaldTrump now! Trump/Pence very important save our America before too late!

Thank you! #AmericaFirst 

As a tribute to the late great Phyllis Schlafly I hope everybody can go out and get her latest book THE CONSERVATIVE CASE FOR TRUMP.

China wouldn't provide a red carpet stairway from Air Force One and then Philippines President calls Obama "the son of a whore." Terrible!

The truly great Phyllis Schlafly who honored me with her strong endorsement for president has passed away at 92. She was very special!

Thank you Ohio! #AmericaFirst

#LaborDay #AmericaFirst Video: 

Can you believe that the Chinese would not give Obama the proper stairway to get off his plane - fight on tarmac! 

President Obama & Putin fail to reach deal on Syria - so what else is new? Obama is not a natural deal maker. Only makes bad deals!

You are a patriot & support @realDonaldTrump. #MAGA by sticking together.

We need to show Americans that Hillary will KILL our Country !! Vote for Trump !!

It defies belief the Web of Lies Hillary is spinning! One excuse after another. Then it's this then it's that.

Lyin' Hillary Clinton told the FBI that she did not know the "C" markings on documents stood for CLASSIFIED. How can this be happening?

To the African-American community: The Democrats have failed you for fifty years high crime poor schools no jobs. I will fix it VOTE "T

The polls are close so Crooked Hillary is getting out of bed and will campaign tomorrow.Why did she hammer 13 devices and acid-wash e-mails?

The Great State of Arizona where I just had a massive rally (amazing people) has a very weak and ineffective Senator Jeff Flake. Sad!

The Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders not weak people such as @JeffFlake if it is going to stop illegal immigration.

Doesn't fit the media narrative - so they wont share what I did for Jesse Jackson in 1999 - so I will!

CNN is so biased. Never ever watch them. Trump 2016!!

Crooked Hillary's V.P. pick said this morning that I was not aware that Russia took over Crimea. A total lie - and taken over during O term!

Wow the failing New York Times has not reported properly on Crooked's FBI release. They are at the back of the pack - no longer a credible source

CNN is so disgusting in their bias but they are having a hard time promoting Crooked Hillary in light of the new e-mail scandals.

Great visit to Detroit church fantastic reception and all @CNN talks about is a small protest outside. Inside a large and wonderful crowd!

I am returning to the Pensacola Bay Center in Florida- Friday 9/9/16 at 7pm. Join me!

Great trip to Mexico today  - wonderful leadership and high quality people! Look forward to our next meeting.

Hillary Clinton didn't go to Louisiana and now she didn't go to Mexico. She doesn't have the drive or stamina to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Former President Vicente Fox who is railing against my visit to Mexico today also invited me when he apologized for using the "f bomb.

Thank you Washington! Together WE will MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN! #ImWithYou #AmericaFirst

Now that African-Americans are seeing what a bad job Hillary type policy and management has done to the inner-cities they want TRUMP!

Crooked Hillary's brainpower is highly overrated.Probably why her decision making is so bad or as stated by Bernie S she has BAD JUDGEMENT

Does anyone know that Crooked Hillary who tried so hard was unable to pass the Bar Exams in Washington D.C. She was forced to go elsewhere

I know of NO ONE voting for Crooked Hillary! Her rallies are held in theatre & she still has room.

Inner-city crime is reaching record levels. African-Americans will vote for Trump because they know I will stop the slaughter going on!

Look how bad it is getting! How much more crime how many more shootings will it take for African-Americans and Latinos to vote Trump=SAFE!

I will be making a major speech on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION on Wednesday in the GREAT State of Arizona. Big crowds looking for a larger venue.

I think that both candidates Crooked Hillary and myself should release detailed medical records. I have no problem in doing so! Hillary?

Today is the 53rd anniversary of the March on Washington - today we honor the enduring fight for justice equality and opportunity.

Army training slide lists Hillary Clinton as insider threat: 

Meet the Trumpocrats: Lifelong Democrats Breaking w/ Party Over Hillary to Support Donald Trump for President: 

Hillary Clinton Deleted Emails Using Program Intended To Prevent Recovery" #CrookedHillary 

How quickly people forget that Crooked Hillary called African-American youth "SUPER PREDATORS" - Has she apologized?

I am very proud to have brought the subject of illegal immigration back into the discussion. Such a big problem for our country-I will solve

Wonderful Pastor Mark Burns was attacked viciously and unfairly on MSNBC by crazy morning mika on low ratings Morning Joe. Apologize!

What do African-Americans and Hispanics have to lose by going with me. Look at the poverty crime and educational statistics. I will fix it!

Flashback: Hillary Clinton Praised Former KKK Member Robert Byrd as 'Friend and Mentor': 

CLINTON CORRUPTION AND HER SABOTAGE OF THE INNER CITIES.  Full speech transcript: 

Hillary Clinton only knows how to make a speech when it is a hit on me. No policy and always very short (stamina). Media gives her a pass!

HRC is using the oldest play in the Dem playbook- when their policies fail they are left w/this one tired argument! 

Hillary Clinton is using race-baiting to try to get African-American voters- but they know she is all talk and NO ACTION!

Hillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society. She should be ashamed of herself!

Just watched recap of #CrookedHillary's speech. Very short and lies. She is the only one fear-mongering!

So many in the African-American community are doing so badly poverty and crime way up employment and jobs way down: I will fix it promise

Poll numbers are starting to look very good. Leading in Florida CNN Arizona and big jump in Utah. All numbers rising national way up. Wow!

Hillary Clinton strongly stated  that there was "absolutely no connection" between her private work and that of The State Department. LIE!

LIE!

It is being reported by virtually everyone and is a fact  that the media pile on against me is the worst in American political history!

I am now in Texas doing a big fundraiser for the Republican Party and a FoxNews Special on the BORDER and with victims of border crime!

The Washington Post quickly put together a hit job book on me- comprised of copies of some of their inaccurate stories. Don't buy boring!

Ann Coulter's new book 'In Trump We Trust comes out tomorrow. People are saying it's terrific - knowing Ann I am sure it is!

Just leaving Akron Ohio after a packed rally. Amazing people! Going now to Texas.

Some day when things calm down I'll tell the real story of @JoeNBC and his very insecure long-time girlfriend @morningmika. Two clowns!

Crooked Hillary is flooding the airwaves with false and misleading ads - all paid for by her bosses on Wall Street. Media is protecting her!

Just as we won the Cold War in part by exposing the evils of communism and the virtues of free markets.... Cont: 

This is my pledge to the American people: 

It's just a 2-point race Clinton 38% Trump 36%' 

Another health insurer is pulling back due to 'persistent financial losses on #Obamacare plans.' Only the beginning! 

#AmericasMerkel 

CLINTON REFUGEE PLAN COULD BRING IN 620000 REFUGEES IN FIRST TERM AT LIFETIME COST OF OVER $400 BILLION." 

#MakeAmericaSafeAgain  

Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad!

Stay on message" is the chant. I always do - trade jobs military vets 2nd A repeal Ocare borders etc - but media misrepresents!

I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!

It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!

I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!

My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.

If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say I would be beating Hillary by 20%

The failing New York Times which never spoke to me keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False I am who I am-never said

The failing New York Times talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary!

You are a man for the people because you know what it is like to be among the people #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #USA Loves U" Thanks

We're all enjoying you as well Mr. T.! You've inspired Hope and a Positive Spirit throughout America! God bless you!" Nice

Yes you are my hero I admire you for laying down your glorious luxurious life to get beat up for America!!!

We now have confirmation as to one reason Crooked H wanted to be sure that nobody saw her e-mails - PAY-FOR-PLAY. How can she run for Pres.

PAY-FOR-PLAY

PAY-FOR-PLAY

Thank you for all that you are doing for us! You campaign endlessly and have spent millions.We love you! #TrumpTrain" Thanks

I am truly enjoying myself while running for president. The people of our country are amazing - great numbers on November 8th!

The failing New York Times has become a newspaper of fiction. Their stories about me always quote non-existent unnamed sources. Very dishonest!

Will be on Sean Hannity tonight at 10pm hosted by @GovMikeHuckabee. Enjoy!

Thank you Erie Pennsylvania! Together we will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 

Unbelievable support in Florida last night - thank you! #MAGA 

ISIS gained tremendous strength during Hillary Clinton's term as Secretary of State. When will the dishonest media report the facts!

I love watching these poor pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out. They can't!

They can't! They can't!

They can't!

They can't!

A massive tax increase will be necessary to fund Crooked Hillary Clinton's agenda. What a terrible (and boring) rollout that was yesterday!

hank you for coming to Pennsylvania today.

Ratings challenged CNN reports so seriously that I call President Obama (and Clinton) "the founder" of ISIS & MVP. THEY DON'T GET SARCASM?

The founder of ISIS!

The founder of ISIS!

The founder of ISIS!

Great job today by the NYPD in protecting the people and saving the climber.

Reuters just announced that Secret Service never spoke to me or my campaign. Made up story by CNN is a hoax. Totally dishonest.

Really admire your determination: Working so hard for all Americans andn daily having to defend yourself from a biased Media.

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 

Thank you!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  

No such meeting or conversation ever happened - a made up story by "low ratings" CNN.

I will be interviewed on Greta. Enjoy! 

My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers shot in Sebastian County Arkansas. #LESM

Morning Joe's weakness is its low ratings. I don't watch anymore but I heard he went wild against Rudy Giuliani and #2A - sad & irrelevant!

You were fantastic in defending both the Second Amendment and me last night on CNN. Don Lemon is a lightweight - dumb as a rock

Dumb as a rock.

Dumb as a rock.

Dumb as a rock.

Now cut off my mic! Bongino refuses to be bullied by Don Lemon over Trump 2nd Amendment  HEATED! 

Media desperate to distract from Clinton's anti-2A stance. I said pro-2A citizens must organize and get out vote to save our Constitution!

When is the media going to talk about Hillary's policies that have gotten people killed like Libya open borders and maybe her emails?

#CrookedHillary is not fit to be our next president! #TrumpPence16  

Heading to New Hampshire - will be talking about Hillary saying her brain SHORT CIRCUITED and other things!

Anybody whose mind "SHORT CIRCUITS" is not fit to be our president! Look up the word "BRAINWASHED.

Crooked Hillary said loudly and for the world to see that she "SHORT CIRCUITED" when answering a question on her e-mails. Very dangerous!

Hillary Clinton is being badly criticized for her poor performance in answering questions. Let us all see what happens!

Good luck #TeamUSA #OpeningCeremony #Rio2016

DRUDGE_REPORT: FORMER HOSTAGE SAYS PLANE WAITED UNTIL MONEY ARRIVED. 

DRUDGE_REPORT: 'Win-lose deal that benefits Iran and hurts United States'. 

Hillary Clinton has bad judgment and is unfit to serve as President. 

The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva Switzerland not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!

President Obama refuses to answer question about Iran terror funding.  I won't dodge questions as your President. 

Obama's disastrous judgment gave us ISIS rise of Iran and the worst economic numbers since the Great Depression!

President Obama should ask the DNC about how they rigged the election against Bernie.

Thanks to @pnehlen for your kind words very much appreciated.

During the GOP convention CNN cut away from the victims of illegal immigrant violence. They dont want them heard. 

When will CNN do a segment on Hillarys plan to increase Syrian refugees 550% and how much it will cost?

Hillary Clinton raked in money from regimes that horribly oppress women and gays & refuses to speak out against Radical Islam.

Hillary whose decisions have led to the deaths of many accepted $ from a business linked to ISIS. Silence at CNN. 

Crooked Hillary Clinton is 100% owned by her donors. #ImWithYou #MAGA 

Thank you Columbus Ohio! I will be back soon. #ImWithYou #MAGA 

Thank you Oklahoma & Virginia!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #ImWithYou 

People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillary....that's really saying something!

The people who support Hillary sit behind CNN anchor chairs or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life.

Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary?

When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary's pay-for-play at State Department?

CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime failing schools and vanishing jobs.

CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton.

Join Governor Mike Pence in Reno Nevada- tonight at 7pm! Tickets available at: 

#CrookedHillary  

So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine they have already taken Crimea and continue to push. That's what I said!

When I said in an interview that Putin is "not going into Ukraine you can mark it down I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea!

This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!

Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice!

Wow, it is unbelievable how distorted, one-sided and biased the media is against us. The failing New York Times is a joke. CNN is laughable!

Without absolutely OWNING the liberal media, HillaryClinton wouldn't stand a chance. #VoterFraud and mainstream media her only hope.

The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H?

I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!

Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our ""leaders"" to eradicate it!

Nielson Media Research final numbers on ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: TRUMP  32.2 MILLION.  CLINTON 27.8 MILLION.  Thank you!

Thank you to all of the television viewers that made my speech at the Republican National Convention #1 over Crooked Hillary and DEMS.

Can you imagine if I had the small crowds that Hillary is drawing today in Pennsylvania. It would be a major media event! CNN FoxNews

NATO commander agrees members should pay up!

NATO commander agrees members should pay up!

NATO commander agrees members should pay up!

Wow, NATO's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must PAY THEIR BILLS. This is a general I will like!

The ""Rust Belt"" was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico. END!

Crooked's stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 - with Bill, VP

#CrookedHillary = Obama's third term, which would be terrible news for our economic growth - seen below. 

Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?

I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!

Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two ""Big Thursdays"" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings

#CrookedHillary 

Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster!

Violent crime is rising across the United States, yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities.

Just got back from Colorado. The love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible. Big crowds!

While I am in OH & PA - you can also join Mike Pence in Nevada on Mon!  
 
American homeownership rate in Q2 2016 was 62.9% - lowest rate in 51yrs. WE will bring back the  'American Dream!' 

'American Dream!'

We are suffering through the worst long-term unemployment in the last 70 years. I want change - Crooked Hillary Clinton does not.

Hillary can never win over Bernie supporters. Her foreign wars,  NAFTA/TPP support & Wall Street ties are driving away millions of votes.

Colorado was amazing yesterday! So much support. Our tax, trade and energy reforms will bring great jobs to Colorado and the whole country.

ONLY TRUMP CAN UNITE AMERICA AND FIX OBAMA'S MISTAKES!!!

As usual, Hillary & the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games. Same as last time w/ Bernie. Unacceptable!

#CrookedHillary Job Application 

Hillary Clinton should not be given national security briefings in that she is a lose cannon with extraordinarily bad judgement & insticts.

Even Bill is tired of the lies, SAD! 
 
What Bernie Sanders really thinks of Crooked Hillary Clinton. 

I am watching Crooked Hillary speak. Same old stuff, our country needs change!

Wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary. She sold them out, V.P. pick!

In Hillary Clinton's America - things get worse. #TrumpPence16 

The dishonest media didn't mention that Bernie Sanders was very angry looking during Crooked's speech. He wishes he didn't make that deal!

Crooked Hillary said that I ""couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign."" Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her!

If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York, he wouldn't get 10% of the vote - they would run him out of town!  #NeverHillary

Little"" Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster!

General John Allen, who I never met but spoke against me last night, failed badly in his fight against ISIS. His record = BAD  #NeverHillary

Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech. Many of her statements were lies and fabrications!

Mike Pence!!

Ann Coulter is very smart!

Ann Coulter is very smart!

Ann Coulter is very smart!

Two policemen just shot in San Diego, one dead. It is only getting worse. People want LAW AND ORDER!

Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and ""forgot"" to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream!

The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. CNN and the little watched Morning Joe = SAD!

SAD!

SAD!

SAD!

SAD!

SAD!

SAD!

SAD!

No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.

Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world.

Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety.

Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street!

Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.

Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.

Departing now - thank you Cedar Rapids, Iowa. This is a MOVEMENT! 

#CrookedHillary 

Dems warn not to underestimate Trump's potential win"" 

Great to be back in Iowa! TBT with Jerry Jr Falwell joining me in Davenport- this past winter. #MAGA 

Median household income is down for the middle class since Obama took office. It will only go further down under Clinton.

A vote for Clinton-Kaine is a vote for TPP, NAFTA, high taxes, radical regulation, and massive influx of refugees.

Bernie caved! 

Donald Trump Sees 17-Point Positive Swing in Two Weeks

Trump makes a funny, obvious joke about Russia going after Hillary's emails & U.S. media goes insane with fury.

Obama Refers to Himself 119 Times During Hillary Nominating Speech... 

President Obama spoke last night about a world that doesnt exist. 70% of the people think our country is going in the wrong direction. #DNC

My message is resonating with the PEOPLE

Barack is offended that I will demand that #NATO allies pay their fair share. #DemsInPhilly

Barack is offended that I will demand that #NATO allies pay their fair share. #DemsInPhilly

Our country does not feel 'great already' to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty, violence and despair.

Shooting deaths of police officers up 78% this year. We must restore law and order and protect our great law enforcement officers!

#CrookedHillary 

Thank you to our amazing law enforcement officers! #MAGA 

Trump right: Illegal families crossing border set to double, 51,152 so far"" 

Great new poll - thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton's 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI!

Join our next Vice President, Mike Pence in Wisconsin tonight & Michigan Thursday! 

Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic

Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to ""carpet bomb"" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz!

Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!

Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!

The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!

Funny how the failing New York Times is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said ""Trump is a genius."" America 1st!

As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.

Just like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP.  

Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep?

I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!

No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated!

You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is, and neither does ISIS (a good thing). Please get your facts straight - thanks. 

For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia.

In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy!

Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here.

Bernie's exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed!

The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!

Thank you New Hampshire!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Join us tomorrow in Scranton, Pennsylvania at 3pm! #TrumpPence16 #MAGA  Tickets: 

Pocahontas bombed last night! Sad to watch.

Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great

Funny, if you listen to Fox News, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference

Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.

Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!

Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.

If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.

I was at Fox News and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!

Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke!

While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.

Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War.

Thank you OHIO! #TrumpPence16 

Thank you Roanoke, Virginia- be back soon! #TrumpPence16 

MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN! #TrumpPence16 

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain  

Great POLL numbers are coming out all over. People don't want another four years of Obama, and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGA

The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!

Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!

Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!

Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her ""servant"" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie.

If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.

Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!

How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!

The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me

Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing!

The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!

The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!

The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!

Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!

Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out

If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild

The CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!

I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!

Today proves what I have always known, that Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz

Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!

There is no longer a Bernie Sanders ""political revolution."" He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!

An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.

Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!

Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!

Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT

The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!

Kaine supported the stupidest deal in the history of deals 

Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart!

The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud!

Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!

I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!

Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!

Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!

Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.

Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED

Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!

Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!

The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?

General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS! #MakeAmericaSafeAgain

I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.

Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?

Another attack, this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich.

One of the best produced, including the incredible stage & set, in the history of conventions. Great unity! Big T.V. ratings!

Thank you Cleveland. We love you and will be back many times!

What a great four days in Cleveland. So proud of the great job done by the RNC and all. The police and Secret Service were fantastic!

MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN! #RNCinCLE 

FORMAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE NOMINATION! #TrumpPence16 

You can watch 360 video live from the podium! 

This is a MOVEMENT! #RNCinCLE 

Thank you Donald J Trump Jr. Proud of you! 

Great job Ivanka Trump! #RNCinCLE 

Other than a small group of people who have suffered massive and embarrassing losses, the party is VERY united. Great love in the arena!

Ted Cruz talks about the Constitution but doesn't say that if the Dems win the Presidency, the new JUSTICES appointed will destroy us all!

I am soooo proud of my children, Don, Eric and Tiffany - their speeches, under enormous pressure, were incredible. Ivanka intros me tonight!

Great job Eric Trump! Proud of you! #AmericaFirst #RNCinCLE 

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Arena was packed, totally electric!

Mike Pence was fantastic tonight. Will be a great V.P.

Our next Vice President of the United States of America, Gov. Mike Pence!

Wow, Ted Cruz got booed off the stage, didn't honor the pledge! I saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway. No big deal!

Great job Eric Trump! Proud of you!  #AmericaFirst #RNCinCLE 

Thank you Scott Walker! #AmericaFirst  #RNCinCLE 

Thank you to Governor Scott Walker for such warm support. Great speech!

Thank you Ingraham!

#AmericaFirst #RNCinCLE  

Watching the #GOPConvention #AmericaFirst #RNCinCLE

John Kasich was never asked by me to be V.P. Just arrived in Cleveland - will be a great two days!

The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails.

Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!

In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs!

Bill Hemmer of FoxNews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. More than in past years.

Congratulations to my children, Don and Tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night. I am very proud of you!

Such a great honor to be the Republican Nominee for President of the United States. I will work hard and never let you down! AMERICA FIRST!

The ROLL CALL is beginning at the Republican National Convention. Very exciting!

Democrats are coming to TRUMP. I used to be proud of the dem party. No more It is crooked and not for the people.

It was truly an honor to introduce my wife, Melania. Her speech and demeanor were absolutely incredible. Very proud! #GOPConvention

Will be on Oreilly Factor tonight at 8:30pm @FoxNews- prior to Melania's speech at the #GOPConvention. Tune in- she will do great!  

Networks other than low ratings @CNN have been very fair and exciting!

CNN is the worst.T hey go to their dumb, one-sided panels when a podium speaker is for Trump! VAST MAJORITY want: Make America Great Again!

Looking forward to being at the convention tonight to watch all of the wonderful speakers including my wife Melania. Place looks beautiful!

President Obama just had a news conference but he doesn't have a clue. Our country is a divided crime scene and it will only get worse!

Our country is totally divided and our enemies are watching. We are not looking good we are not looking smart we are not looking tough!

Bad times for divided USA!

Bad times for divided USA!

Bad times for divided USA!

Bad times for divided USA!

We are TRYING to fight ISIS and now our own people are killing our police. Our country is divided and out of control. The world is watching

We grieve for the officers killed in Baton Rouge today. How many law enforcement and people have to... 

The ratings at Fox News blow away the ratings of CNN - not even close. That's because CNN is the Clinton News Network and people don't like

Fox News is much better and far more truthful than CNN which is all negative. Guests are stacked for Crooked Hillary! I don't watch.

If Goofy Elizabeth Warren a very weak Senator didn't lie about her heritage (being Native American) she would be nothing today. Pick her H

I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas as her V.P. Then we can litigate her fraud!

It doesn't matter that Crooked Hillary has experience look at all of the bad decisions she has made. Bernie said she has bad judgement!

As the days and weeks go by  we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in - Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions!

We are going to have a great time in Cleveland. Will lead to special results for our country. We will Make America Great Again!

Goofy Elizabeth Warren who may be the least productive Senator in the U.S. Senate must prove she is not a fraud. Without the con it's over

Thank you to Jack Morgan Tamara Neo Cheryl Ann Kraft and all of my friends and supporters in Virginia. GREAT JOB!

Great news! We've been nominated for Ireland's Best Golf Hotel 2016. We would appreciate your vote! 

Thank you to Chris Cox and Bikers for Trump - Your support has been amazing. I will never forget. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Thank you! #TrumpPence16 

Crooked Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for by Wall Street lobbyists and special interests. She will sell our country down the tubes!

Very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes Crooked Hillary Clinton can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money!

Crooked Hillary who embarrassed herself and the country with her e-mail lies has been a DISASTER on foreign policy. Look what's happening!

Crooked Hillary is spending big Wall Street money on ads saying I don't have foreign policy experience yet look what her policies have done

Look forward to introducing Governor Mike Pence (who has done a spectacular job in the great State of Indiana). My first choice from start!

Look forward to Governor Mike Pence V.P. introduction tomorrow in New York City.

I am pleased to announce that I have chosen Governor Mike Pence as my Vice Presidential running mate. News conference tomorrow at 11:00 A.M.

Four more years of weakness with a Crooked Hillary Administration is not acceptable. Look what has happened to the world with O & Hillary!

#NeverTrump is never more. They were crushed last night in Cleveland at Rules Committee by a vote of 87-12. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

My prayers and condolences to the victims and families of the terrible tragedy in Nice France. We are with you in every way!

In light of the horrible attack in Nice France I have postponed tomorrow's news conference concerning my Vice Presidential announcement.

Another horrific attack this time in Nice France. Many dead and injured. When will we learn? It is only getting worse.

I employ many people in the State of Virginia - JOBS JOBS JOBS! Crooked Hillary will sell us out just like her husband did with NAFTA.

Another new poll. Thank you for your support! Join the MOVEMENT today!  #ImWithYou 

Great new poll- thank you America! #Trump2016 #ImWithYou 

I will be making the announcement of my Vice Presidential pick on Friday at 11am in Manhattan. Details to follow.

If I win the Presidency we will swamp Justice Ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions!

Even the NYTimes and Washington Post Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach. What was she thinking?

Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge!

On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party. I am spending a lot myself and also helping others.

Voters understand that Crooked Hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity.

Despite spending $500k a day on TV ads alone #CrookedHillary falls flat in nationwide Quinnipiac Poll. Having ZERO impact. Sad!!

Despite spending $500k a day on TV ads alone #CrookedHillary falls flat in nationwide Quinnipiac Poll. Having ZERO impact. Sad!!

Sad!!

Sad!!

Lyin' Crooked Hillary's email stories all have one thing in common. 

Is President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves? Think about it and let me know!

The Republican platform is most  pro-Israel of all time!

New GOP platform now includes language that supports the border wall. We will build the wall and MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!

#CrookedHillary is outspending me by a combined 31 to 1 in Florida Ohio & Pennsylvania. I haven't started yet! 

Thank you Florida Ohio and Pennsylvania! #CrookedHillary is not qualified. 

Justice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot - resign! 

The American people agree. No free pass for #CrookedHillary! 

To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals & global special interests we welcome you with open arms. People first.

Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton.

Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.

#CrookedHillary is not qualified! 

I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. They are not happy that he is selling out!

Bernie Sanders who has lost most of his leverage has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry!

This election is a choice between law order & safety - or chaos crime & violence. I will make America safe again for everyone. #ImWithYou

For too many years our inner cities have been left behind. I am going to deliver jobs safety and protection for those in need.

Crime is out of control and rapidly getting worse. Look what is going on in Chicago and our inner cities. Not good!

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #ImWithYou 

Senior United States District Judge Robert E. Payne today ruled in favor of Trump campaign delegates who had argued..

Speech on Veterans' Reform: 

Great poll- Florida! Thank you! 

Thoughts and prayers with the victims and their families- along with everyone at the Berrien County Courthouse in St. Joseph Michigan.

Join me in Westfield Indiana- tomorrow night at 7:30pm! #Trump2016  Tickets: 

I heard that the underachieving John King of CNN on Inside Politics was one hour of lies. Happily few people are watching - dead network!

The media is so dishonest. If I make a statement they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish.They think the public is stupid!

President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. He is living in a world of the make believe!

Look what is happening to our country under the WEAK leadership of Obama and people like Crooked Hillary Clinton. We are a divided nation!

New poll - thank you! #Trump2016 

Way to go Serena Williams  - you are a true champion. Proud of you!

MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN! 

Isn't it sad that on a day of national tragedy Hillary Clinton is answering softball questions about her email lies on CNN?

Due to the horrific events taking place in our country I have decided to postpone my speech on economic opportunity- today in Miami.

Last night's horrific execution-style shootings of 12 Dallas law enforcement officers...

Prayers and condolences to all of the families who are so thoroughly devastated by the horrors we are all watching take place in our country

After today Crooked Hillary can officially be called Lyin' Crooked Hillary.

Just leaving D.C. Had great meetings with Republicans in the House and Senate. Very interesting day! These are people who love our country!

Great being in Cincinnati Ohio last night- thank you! Off to Washington D.C. now. #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst 

Where is the outrage for this Disney book? Is this the 'Star of David' also?  Dishonest media! #Frozen 

To all of my twitter followers please contribute whatever you can to the campaign. We must beat Crooked Hillary. 

Convention speaker schedule to be released tomorrow. Let today be devoted to Crooked Hillary and the rigged system under which we live.

I have over seven million hits on social media re Crooked Hillary Clinton. Check it out Sleepy Eyes 

Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd a man with so little touch for politics is at it again. He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C.

Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd a man with so little touch for politics is at it again. He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C.

Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City.

Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center Airport - and destroyed City

I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes now many bankruptcies.

Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch her time will come!

The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges but...

Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest incompetent and of very bad judgement.

Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive highly classified information." Not fit!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT!

I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with "murder." Come November 8 she's out!

Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win

FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem

The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual bad judgment.

It was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday. She has done a fantastic job for the people of Iowa and U.S. Will see her again!

Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace!

Meet the Trumps! Hope you enjoy!

Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?

Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?

With Hillary and Obama the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is "guilty as hell" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33000 missing e-mails?

The only people who are not interested in being the V.P. pick are the people who have not been asked!

I look forward to meeting Joni Ernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!

I look forward to meeting Joni Ernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!

I look forward to meeting Joni Ernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!

Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday. Very impressed great people!

Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday. Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd the end result was solid!

Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff's Star or plain star!

Happy 4th of July! #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst 

Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change!

The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this!

In Bangladesh hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed!

I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!

The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting "go away no pictures.

Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about "grandkids" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?

THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!

THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!

THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!

On Saturday a great man Elie Wiesel passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!

Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged & corrupt!

Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.

Just watched meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd and the entire show is against me.The good news-the people get it!

It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said the system is totally rigged!

It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!


Reminder: last year Clinton pledged she had turned over all work-related email under penalty of perjury  

Thank you! #AmericaFirst 

If I become the next POTUS- they will not be ignoring!  

If I become the next POTUS- they will not be ignoring!  

Crooked Hillary -- Makes History!

The #2A to our Constitution is clear. The right of the people to keep & bear Arms shall not be infringed upon. 

#AmericaFirst #ImWithYou 

The speakers slots at the Republican Convention are totally filled with a long waiting list of those that want to speak - Wednesday release

Just read in the failing New York Times that I was not aware "the event had to be held in Cleveland" - a total lie. These people are sick!

When you can't say it - or see it -- you can't fix it. We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN! #ImWithYou #AmericaFirst 

These crimes won't be happening if I'm elected POTUS. Killer should have never been here. #AmericaFirst  

Yet another terrorist attack today in Israel -- a father shot at by a Palestinian terrorist was killed while: 

Horrible killing of a 13 year old American girl at her home in Israel by a Palestinian terrorist. We must get tough. 

Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton. The system is totally rigged. Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?

Bill Clinton's meeting was a total secret. Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter.

As Bernie Sanders said Hillary Clinton has bad judgement. Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary!

The reason I put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. $50 million loan. I have totally terminated the loan!

The very dishonest NBC News refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign. Done deal!

One of the reasons Hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldn't see how she got rich- selling out America.  

Why would college graduates want Crooked Hillary as their President? She will destroy them!  

The story with Hillary will never change. 

For reasons only they can explain the US Chamber wants to continue our bad trade deals rather than renegotiating and making them better.

Tremendous day in Massachusetts and Maine. Thank you to everyone for making it so special!

As of April this year Hillary had spent $2640000 on her campaign Mr.Trump $550000. Self Funding

ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will. Not capable!

ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will. Not capable!

ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will. Not capable!

Why would the USChamber be upset by the fact that I want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that I want penalties for cheaters?

The US CHAMBER must fight harder for the American worker. China and many others are taking advantage of U.S. with our terrible trade pacts

Iron Mike Tyson was not asked to speak at the Convention though I'm sure he would do a good job if he was. The media makes everything up!

This administration is incapable of keeping our country safe!

We must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the United States.

Yet another terrorist attack this time in Turkey. Will the world ever realize what is going on? So sad.

Hillary Clintons Presidency would be catastrophic for the future of our country. She is ill-fit with bad judgment.

Benghazi is just another Hillary Clinton failure. It just never seems to work the way it's supposed to with Clinton.

Check it out - 2nd video on Lying Crooked Hillary is now online! Watch it here:  

Cancel cable - sick of their bad coverage of you and the fawning over Clinton. Listened to your great speech on YouTube


Cancel cable - sick of their bad coverage of you and the fawning over Clinton. Listened to your great speech on YouTube

Ann Coulter also can't help but notice the stock market's reaction as I was speaking. #UPUPUP

Create jobs!

Maybe If corporations weren't overtaxed they would stay.

CNN is all negative when it comes to me. I don't watch it anymore.

The media is unrelenting. They will only go with and report a story in a negative light. I called Brexit (Hillary was wrong) watch November

Crooked Hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the U.S. Senate goofy Elizabeth Warren who lied on heritage.

Under a Trump presidency America will make brilliant new trade deals!

Hillary read "sigh" off the Teleprompter She's so fake she has to be told how to feel!

Hillary read "sigh" off the Teleprompter She's so fake she has to be told how to feel!

W know they're fake just like poles during primary. I'm sure I will crush #CrookedHillary in general

The "dirty" poll done by ABC is a disgrace. Even they admit that many more Democrats were polled. Other polls were good.

Crooked Hillary Attacks Foreign Government Donations - While Ignoring Her Own: 

Crooked Hillary Clinton got Brexit wrong. I said LEAVE will win. She has no sense of markets and such bad judgement. Only a question of time

Hillary Clinton is not a change agent just the same old status quo! She is spending a fortune I am spending very little. Close in polls!

People in our country want borders and without them the old line pols like Crooked Hillary will not win. It is time for CHANGE -- and JOBS!

Top 50 Facts About Crooked Hillary Clinton From Trump 'Stakes Of The Election' Address: 

The ABC poll sample is heavy on Democrats.  Very dishonest - why would they do that? Other polls good!

Crooked Hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at Turnberry. Shows me hitting shot but I never did = lie! Was there to support son

Clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on BREXIT with big dollar ads. Disgraceful!

Crooked Hillary Clinton who called BREXIT 100% wrong (along with Obama) is now spending Wall Street money on an ad on my correct call.

George Will one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago) has left the Republican Party.He's made many bad calls

Just landed in New York - a one night stay in Scotland. Turnberry came out magnificently. My son Eric did a great job - under budget!

Obama has blocked ICE officers and BP from doing their jobs. That ends when I am President!

I have never liked the media term 'mass deportation' -- but we must enforce the laws of the land!

We only want to admit those who love our people and support our values. #AmericaFirst

We must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place.

So funny Crooked Hillary called BREXIT so incorrectly and now she says that she is the one to deal with the U.K. All talk no action!

Thoughts and prayers are with everyone in West Virginia- dealing with the devastating floods. #ImWithYou

And we will get it back once we have President Trump! Can't wait!

What has happened in the UK in the last 12 hours is exactly what will happen in November..vote TRUMP 2016

Many people are equating BREXIT and what is going on in Great Britain with what is happening in the U.S. People want their country back!

The opening of Trump Turnberry in Scotland was a big success. Good timing I was here for BREXIT. Very exciting news conference today!

Crooked Hillary called it totally wrong on BREXIT - she went with Obama - and now she is saying we need her to lead. She would be a disaster

I want all Americans to succeed together. President Obama's illegal executive amnesty undermines job prospects for...

New Government data by the Center for Immigration Studies shows more than 3M new legal & illegal immigrants settled..

America is proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder w/a free & ind UK. We stand together as friends as allies & as a people w/a shared history.

Self-determination is the sacred right of all free people's and the people of the UK have exercised that right for all the world to see.

Getting ready to open the magnificent Turnberry in Scotland. What a great day especially when added to the brave & brilliant vote.

Statement Regarding British Referendum on E.U. Membership 

Just arrived in Scotland. Place is going wild over the vote. They took their country back just like we will take America back. No games!

Congratulations to my son Eric on the fantastic job he has done in rebuilding Turnberry and its great Ailsa Course. Always support kids!

Leaving now for a one night trip to Scotland in order to be at the Grand Opening of my great Turnberry Resort. Will be back on Sat. night!

Meet the amazing mother whose letter I read during my speech. She lost her son to policies supported by Clinton. 

Read my full statement here on the Supreme Court's executive amnesty decision #imwithyou  

Here is another CNN lie. The Clinton News Network is losing all credibility. Im not watching it much anymore.  

CNN which is totally biased in favor of Clinton should apologize. They knew they were wrong.  

Trump's speech today is the best persuasion I have ever seen. Game over. 

Our inner cities have been left behind. We will never have the resources to support our people if we have an open border.

On immigration Im consulting with our immigration officers & our wage-earners. Hillary Clinton is consulting with Wall Street.

Obama & Clinton should stop meeting with special interests & start meeting with the victims of illegal immigration.

Hillary Clintons open borders are tearing American families apart. I am going to make our country Safe Again for all Americans. #Imwithyou

SC has kept us safe from exec amnesty--for now. But Hillary has pledged to expand it taking jobs from Hispanic & African-American workers.

I was so impressed by my speech yesterday. He was the best I've ever seen him." 

Hillary Lies to Benghazi Families #CrookedHillary  

ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama."  --  Donald J. Trump

Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency."  --   Donald J. Trump

Thank you to Donald Rumsfeld for the endorsement. Very much appreciated. Clinton's conduct has been "disqualifying.

You have great children future presidents...and we all see were raised right and out there for their father." Thank you.

Hillary says things can't change. I say they have to change. It's a choice between Americanism and her corrupt globalism. #Imwithyou

Crooked Hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief! She will be a disaster for jobs and the economy!

I will be interviewed by Lou Dobbs

Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State. She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich! Corrupt dangerous dishonest.

If you want to know about Hillary Clinton's honesty & judgment ask the family of Ambassador Stevens.

Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays.

I am "the king of debt."That has been great for me as a businessman but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt will fix U.S.

Obama-Clinton inherited $10T in debt and turned it into nearly $20T.  They have bankrupted 

Hillary Clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans - and make everyone less safe.

How can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk?

Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as Secretary of State costing Americans millions of jobs.

Hillary says this election is about judgment.  She's right.  Her judgement has killed thousands unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy.

I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton.

Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our president-really bad judgement and a temperament according to new book which is a mess!

When I said that if within the Orlando club you had some people with guns I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees

We are so proud of you Dustin. Your reaction under pressure was amazing. First of many Majors. You are a true CHAMPION!

Yesterday's failing NYTimes fraudulently shows an empty room prior to my speech when in fact it was packed! 

How can the NY Times show an empty room hours before my speech even started when they knew it was going to be packed? So totally dishonest!

My Speech Is a Game Changer.

Thank you Dallas PD!  

Join me in Phoenix Arizona tomorrow at 4pm! #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst

Common Sense Conservative! President Trump = Competence Safety Unity & US JOBS JOBS JOB.

The speech today was Churchillian only better.  You can tell by the spluttering hysteria on TV.

Finally an accurate story from the Washington Post!   

Thank you Atlanta Georgia! Will be back soon! #AmericaFirst 

I will be meeting with the NRA who has endorsed me about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list or the no fly list to buy guns.

The press is so totally biased that we have no choice but to take our tough but fair and smart message directly to the people!

An: Media fell all over themselves criticizing what DonaldTrump "may have insinuated about POTUS." But he's right: 

HAPPY 241st BIRTHDAY to the @USArmy! THANK YOU! 

Thank you to the LGBT community! I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs.

AMERICA FIRST!

American must now get very tough very smart and very vigilant. We cannot admit people into our country without extraordinary screening.

Join me in Atlanta on Wednesday- at noon! #Trump2016 Tickets: 

Crooked Hillary says we must call on Saudi Arabia and other countries to stop funding hate. I am calling on- cont'd: 

Saudi Arabia and many of the countries that gave vast amounts of money to the Clinton Foundation- cont'd: 

I thought people werent celebrating? They were cheering all over even this savage from Orlando. I was right. 

In my speech on protecting America I spoke about a temporary ban which includes suspending immigration from nations tied to Islamic terror.

Based on the incredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting of the record setting Trump campaign we are hereby:  

I am no fan of President Obama but to show you how dishonest the phony Washington Post is: 

Anyone who plans to talk about Trump ever again has to see this speech.  Your opinion is irrelevant unless you listened

TERRORISM IMMIGRATION AND NATIONAL SECURITY SPEECH- TRANSCRIPT: 

I am watching FoxNews and how fairly they are treating me and my words and CNN and the total distortion of my words and what I am saying

I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror. Hillary just broke-said she would now use!

What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough

Please make us safe. We cannot have Hillary as president. We will be in so much trouble.

Reporting that Orlando killer shouted "Allah hu Akbar!" as he slaughtered clubgoers. 2nd man arrested in LA with rifles near Gay parade.

Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace!

Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism I don't want congrats I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!

Horrific incident in FL. Praying for all the victims & their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough smart & vigilant?

Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame!

Really bad shooting in Orlando. Police investigating possible terrorism. Many people dead and wounded.

Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas pretended to be a Native American in order to advance her career. Very racist!

Riley Rone was a great young man. We will miss him dearly. 

Thank you to our amazing law enforcement officers! #AmericaFirst 

Thank you Tampa Florida! #AmericaFirst #TrumpTrain 

Sad case- USATODAY did article saying I don't pay bills- false only don't pay when work is shoddy bad or not done! They should do same!

In Tampa Florida- thank you to all of our outstanding volunteers who want to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 

Don King and so many other African Americans who know me well and endorsed me would not have done so if they thought I was a racist!

Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist-but I am least racist person there is

Thank you FaithandFreedom Coalition! An honor joining you today- to discuss our shared values. #RTM2016 #Trump2016 

Heading to Richmond Virginia now. Join me tonight! #Trump2016 Tickets: 

I rarely agree with President Obama- however he is 100% correct about Crooked Hillary Clinton. Great ad!

Heading to D.C. to speak at Faith and Freedom Coalition and visit OPO.

Donald Trump Plans To Continue GOP Legacy Of Leading On Womens Civil Rights Against Racist Sexist Democrats"  

The great boxing promoter Don King just endorsed me. Nice!

Never before has a president endorsed someone under investigation by The Justice Dept. 33000 emails!

Pocahontas is at it again! Goofy Elizabeth Warren one of the least productive U.S. Senators has a nasty mouth. Hope she is V.P. choice.

Trump's Historic 13 Million Primary Votes.

How long did it take your staff of 823 people to think that up--and where are your 33000 emails that you deleted? 

A message of condolences and support regarding the terrorist attacks in Tel Aviv:  

Obama just endorsed Crooked Hillary. He wants four more years of Obamabut nobody else does!

Crooked Hillary Clinton will be a disaster on jobs the economy trade healthcare the military guns and just about all else. Obama plus!

As expected the media is very much against me. Their dishonesty is amazing but just like our big wins in the primaries we will win!

Bernie Sanders must really dislike Crooked Hillary after the way she played him. Many of his supporters because of trade will come to me.

I would have had many millions of votes more than Crooked Hillary Clinton except for the fact that I had 16 opponents she had one!

Senator Sanders spent more than me yet lost.

THE PEOPLE NEED TRUMP2 make USA RICH!

Number one presidency of all time

Top RINO hack for MSNBC Joey Scarborough on the air and calling the next President Trump a racist and bigot. Shame on you

Nobody is watching Morning Joe anymore. Gone off the deep end - bad ratings. You won't believe what I am watching now!

Vote for me at least you'll have a job.

Thank you to all for your wonderful comments on my speech. I could feel the electricity in thr air. Great reviews - most votes ever recieved

In just out book Secret Service Agent Gary Byrne doesn't believe that Crooked Hillary has the temperament or integrity to be the president!

A former Secret Service Agent for President Clinton excoriates Crooked Hillary describing her as ERRATIC & VIOLENT. Bad temperament for pres

See when I said NATO was obsolete because of no terrorism protection they made the change without giving me credit.

My next project is pretty amazing!

Remembering the fallen heroes on DDay. 

I am getting bad marks from certain pundits because I have a small campaign staff. But small is good flexible save money and number one!

A massive blow to Obama's message - only 38000 new jobs for month in just issued jobs report. That's REALLY bad!

Crooked Hillary is being badly criticized (for a Wall Street paid for ad) by PolitiFact for a false ad on me on women. She is a total fraud!

Crooked Hillary Clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months. Her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions!

Just like I have been able to spend far less money than  others on the campaign and finish #1 so too should our country. We can be great!

People at NBC report on my campaign but have zero access. They say what they want without any knowledge.True of so much of media!

Hillary Clinton is unfit to be president. She has bad judgement poor leadership skills and a very bad and destructive track record. Change!

I am watching CNN very little lately because they are so biased against me. Shows are predictable garbage! CNN and MSM is one big lie!

The Clinton News Network sometimes referred to as @CNN is getting more and more biased.They act so indignant-hear them behind closed doors

Our ineffective POTUS has to make a speech in Elkhart to make everything look great.n

Thank you Attorney General Gonzales so many people feel this way.  

We just had the worst jobs report since 2010.

The Mayor of San Jose did a terrible job of ordering the  protection of innocent people. The thugs were lucky supporters remained peaceful!

Many of the thugs that attacked the peaceful Trump supporters in San Jose were illegals. They burned the American flag and laughed at police.

Heres The HILLARY UNIVERSITY Scandal No One In The Media Is Talking About 

Muhammad Ali is dead at 74! A truly great champion and a wonderful guy. He will be missed by all!

Great evening in San Jose other than the thugs. My supporters are far tougher if they want to be but fortunately they are not hostile.

So much interest in my visit to Scotland! I greatly look forward to attending the opening event @TrumpTurnberry- taking place on June 24th.

I'm a former chief of police in a border town. I'm Hispanic I'm proud to be Hispanic and I'm 100% behind Trump." 

In Crooked Hillary's telepromter speech yesterday she made up things that I said or believe but have no basis in fact. Not honest!

I don't watch or do @Morning_Joe anymore. Small audience low ratings! I hear Mika has gone wild with hate. Joe is Joe. They lost their way!

Rally last night in San Jose was great. Tremendous love and enthusiasm in the hall. Big crowd. Outside small group of thugs burned Am flag!

Terrible jobs report just reported. Only 38000 jobs added. Bombshell!

I think the first female president of the USA will be Ivanka Trump a beautiful intelligent young genuine successful lady!

I think the first female president of the USA will be Ivanka Trump a beautiful intelligent young genuine successful lady!

I think the first female president of the USA will be Ivanka Trump a beautiful intelligent young genuine successful lady!

Clinton says I'm dangerous. Who's the one who killed 4 Americans in Benghazi?  

Looks like several legal Hispanics supporting Trump! They know he will be good for them too.

Back to the USA to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

After Scotland I will visit @rumpDoonbeg in Ireland the magnificent resort fronting on the Atlantic Ocean.

Beautiful article about me written by my friend the incredibly talented golfer Natalie Gulbis. 

Only Trump can save America. Right leader at the right time. THANK YOU!

She's a criminal and I'm the only person that can stop her.

THIS IS @POTUS'S LEGACY! AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER!!! WE NEED to MAGA now! 

A vote for Trump is a vote to restore our great country.

A 60% increase in Texas Blue Cross/Blue Shield through ObamaCare. I told you so there is panic and anger as healthcare costs explode!

So great to have the endorsement and support of Paul Ryan. We will both be working very hard to Make America Great Again!

Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton! Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn't even look presidential!

Crooked Hillary no longer has credibility - too much failure in office. People will not allow another four years of incompetence!

Crooked Hillary Clinton who I would love to call Lyin' Hillary is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions.

After the litigation is disposed of and the case won I have instructed my execs to open Trump U(?) so much interest in it! I will be pres.

Even though I have a very biased and unfair judge in the Trump U civil case in San Diego I have thousands of great reviews & will win case!

With all of the Crooked Hillary Clinton's foreign policy experience she has made so many mistakes - and I mean real monsters! No more HRC.

Join me in San Jose California- tonight! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 Tickets: 

Wow USA Today did todays cover story on my record in lawsuits. Verdict: 450 wins 38 losses. Isn't that what you want for your president?

Do you ever notice that CNN gives me very little proper representation on my policies. Just watched-nobody knew anything about my foreign P

Bernie Sanders was right when he said that Crooked Hillary Clinton was not qualified to be president because she suffers from BAD judgement!

Crooked Hillary Clinton has zero natural talent - she should not be president. Her temperament is bad and her decision making ability-zilch!

Same failing New York Times "reporter" who wrote discredited women's story last week wrote another terrible story on me today- will never learn!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is a fraud who has put the public and country at risk by her illegal and very stupid use of e-mails. Many missing!

So I raised/gave $5600000 for the veterans and the media makes me look bad! They do anything to belittle - totally biased.

Congratulations to Sean Hannity on his tremendous increase in television ratings. Speaking of ratings- I will be on his show tonight

I am getting great credit for my press conference today. Crooked Hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days.

Katie Couric the third rate reporter who has been largely forgotten should be ashamed of herself for the fraudulent editing of her doc.

So many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money I raised/gave! It was my great honor - they do an amazing job.

Just finished a press conference in Trump Tower wherein I gave information on which VETERANS groups got the $5600000 that I raised/gave!

I have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great VETERANS and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so. Watch!

So many great things happening - new poll numbers looking good! News conference at 11:00 A.M. today Trump Tower!

I should have easily won the Trump University case on summary judgement but have a judge Gonzalo Curiel who is totally biased against me.

I have a judge in the Trump University civil case Gonzalo Curiel (San Diego) who is very unfair. An Obama pick. Totally biased-hates Trump

I hope everyone had a great Memorial Day!

I would have had millions of votes more in the primaries (than Crooked Hillary) if I only had one opponent instead of sixteen. Broke record

Have a great Memorial Day and remember that we will soon MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Illegals are taken care of better than our veterans.  

The endorsement of me by the 16500 Border Patrol Agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate. Nice!

In getting the endorsement of the 16500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you) the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary!

Obama says a WALL at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at W.H.

I will build the wall! That I can tell you!

I will build the wall! That I can tell you!

I will build the wall! That I can tell you!

I will build the wall! That I can tell you!

I will build the wall! That I can tell you!

If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent say good bye to the Supreme Court!

The Republican Party has to be smart & strong if it wants to win in November. Can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate!

Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser but if the GOP can't control their own then they are not a party. Be tough R's!

Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics- b/c I stand 100% behind everything we do.

Honor Memorial Day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country! We love them.

Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he's in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost. #MDW

Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me!

I am always on the front page of the failing New York Times but when I won the GOP nomination I'm in the back of the paper. Very dishonest!

The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money & get much better results! What we need as Prez!

The failing New York Times wrote a story about my management style & that I don't have many people. I have 73 Hillary has 800- & I'm beating her.

I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary - by a lot - and with many states left to go! Thank you.

The U.S. has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders. How nice but what do we get? NOT ENOUGH

Obama administration fails to screen Syrian refugees' social media accounts: 

Fantastic job on handling the thugs who tried to disrupt our very peaceful and well attended rally. Greatly appreciated!

Thank you Billy Joel. Many friends just told me you gave a very kind shoutout at MSG. Appreciate it- love your music!

Wow- 25000 in San Diego California! Thank you!!  

AN AMERICA FIRST ENERGY PLAN #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Poll data shows that Marco Rubio does by far the best in holding onto his Senate seat in Florida. Important to keep the MAJORITY. Run Marco!

Today we together won the Republican Nomination for President! 

My wife MELANIA TRUMP and my children will be featured on FoxNews

I find it offensive that Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas pretended to be Native American to get in Harvard.

Thank you Mr. & Mrs. Tom Barrack Jr for the wonderful and magical evening last night. It will not be forgotten.

The Inspector General's report on Crooked Hillary Clinton is a disaster. Such bad judgement and temperament cannot be allowed in the W.H.

Thank you Anaheim California! #Trump2016 

Thank you Washington! Honored to say on behalf of our great movement we have broken the all time record for votes in GOP primary history.

The protesters in New Mexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican flag. The rally inside was big and beautiful but outside criminals!

Crooked Hillary Clinton just can't close the deal with Bernie. I had to knock out 16 very good and smart candidates. Hillary doesn't have it

Goofy Senator Elizabeth Warren @elizabethforma has done less in the U.S. Senate than practically any other senator. All talk no action!

Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes known as Pocahontas bought foreclosed housing and made a quick killing. Total hypocrite!

After raising w/ no obligation almost $6M for Vets I couldn't believe protesters formed @ Trump Tower. JUST OUT- SENT BY CROOKED HILLARY!

I blame the dishonest media.

A wonderfully written article concerning Israel. 

A great new book has been written about Crooked Hillary. Read it & you will never be able to vote for her.

My favorite book is the bible, and second favorite Art of the Deal.

Crooked Hillary Clinton overregulates overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs. Most importantly she suffers from plain old bad judgement!

I just released my financial disclosure forms the largest numbers in the history of the F.E.C. Even the dishonest media thinks great!

Amazingly with all of the money I have raised for the vets I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media.

Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups.

While under no obligation to do so I have raised between 5 & 6 million dollars including 1million dollars from me for our VETERANS. Nice!

Obamas VA Secretary just said we shouldn't measure wait times. Hillary says VA problems are not widespread. I will take care of our vets!

Is Hillary really protecting women? 

In trade military and EVERYTHING else it will be AMERICA FIRST! This will quickly lead to our ultimate goal: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

The American people are sick and tired of not being able to lead normal lives and to constantly be on the lookout for terror and terrorists!

Bernie Sanders is continuing his quest because he believes that Crooked Hillary Clinton will be forced out of the race - e-mail scandal!

Crooked Hillary wants a radical 500% increase in Syrian refugees. We cant allow this. Time to get smart and protect America!

How can Crooked Hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical Islam which horribly oppresses women?

BREAKING POLL: Trump Gains 11 Points on Clinton Since March. Now Leads Crooked Hillary 46-44 

Why do the networks continue to put dopey Bill Kristol on panels when he has called every single shot about me wrong for 2 yrs?

Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad! Would be four more years of stupidity!

Crooked Hillary said that I  want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong!

I WILL do the right thing for the U.S.A without a doubt.

Thank you to all of the men and women who have served our country. You are our true heroes! #ArmedForcesDay 

Crooked Hillary Clintons foreign interventions unleashed ISIS in Syria Iraq and Libya. She is reckless and dangerous!

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

CNN is so negative getting even worse as I get closer. Just had two anti-Trump losers with zero rebuttal from my team. Turning off!

Hillary wants to rip the guns out of America's hands. No guns = no protection. Get on #TrumpTrain & join NRA to stop her.

Crooked Hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed. No more guns to protect Hillary!

While our wonderful president was out playing golf all day the TSA is falling apart just like our government! Airports a total disaster!

Crooked Hillary is spending tremendous amounts of Wall Street money on false ads against me. She is a very dishonest person!

Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment. No gun owner can ever vote for Clinton!

Colin great to have you at Trump Turnberry. So proud of you and your GREAT playing! You made winning MAJORS look easy!

Best Links Course in Britain. Ailsa Course opens June '16 Can't wait to play it 

We will not disappoint!

Great day in Kentucky with Wayne LaPierre and the NRA!  

Failing New York Times will always take a good story about me and make it bad. Every article is unfair and biased. Very sad!

Trump is the most unpredictable extraordinary entertaining & massively popular candidate this country has ever seen.

I am on my way! See you all soon! 

Crooked Hillary can't even close the deal with Bernie - and the Dems have it rigged in favor of Hillary. Four more years of this? No way!

Crooked Hillary Clinton looks presidential? I don't think so! Four more years of Obama and our country will never come back. ISIS LAUGHS!

Look where the world is today a total mess and ISIS is still running around wild. I can fix it fast Hillary has no chance!

Crooked Hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina. ISIS China Russia and all would love for her to be president. 4 more years!

I said that Crooked Hillary Clinton is "not qualified" to be president because she has "very bad judgement" - Bernie said the same thing!

Looks like yet another terrorist attack. Airplane departed from Paris. When will we get tough smart and vigilant? Great hate and sickness!

My list of potential U.S. Supreme Court Justices was very well recieved. During the next number of weeks I may be adding to the list!

Some low-life journalist claims that I "made a pass" at her 29 years ago. Never happened! Like the @nytimes story which has become a joke!

Why did Clinton supporters declare Crooked Hillary winner in KY when AP hasn't even called the race?

Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Democrats - the system is rigged against him. Many of his disenfranchised fans are for me!

Paul Begala the dopey CNN flunky and head of the Pro-Hillary Clinton Super PAC has knowingly committed fraud in his first ad against me.

Trump for President! Bernie is a joke knows nothing - and Hillary is yesterday's and today's nightmare

The Trump movement will not be stopped. We support Trump because he is a true American looking out for #AmericaFIRST.

Congratulations to THE MOVEMENT we have just won THE GREAT STATE OF OREGON. The vote percentage is even higher than anticipated! Thank you.

Hillary Just Handed me a huge Gift. Promising to Put Bubba in Charge of the Economy!

No way I believe Trump at 70% disapproval with women. Went to 3 rallies. At least 1/2 women. MSM Lies! MSM Lies!

Michael Barbaro the author of the now discredited New York Times hit piece on me with women has in past tweeted badly about me. He should resign

He will destroy Hillary but why give CNN record breaking ratings CNN can go to hell. Trump 2016

I look so forward to debating Crooked Hillary Clinton! Democrat Primaries are rigged e-mail investigation is rigged - so time to get it on!

I can't believe that @CNN would allow the very nice Jeffrey Lord to be savaged by a panel of seven Trump haters. 7 to 1 - Don't watch CNN!

I am a pillar of strength and will be perfect as our next president

Well that is it. Well done Megyn --- and they all lived happily ever after! Now let us all see how "THE MOVEMENT" does in Oregon tonight!

Will go back on for a final question now! Amazing job

Great interview! Happy you had a chance to show the other side. Never change never forget you are our messenger!

I like Michael Douglas!

I like Michael Douglas!

One thing we know for sure Bernie Sanders supporters will turn to #Trump - absolutely not HillaryClinton

I speak from the heart for all of America. His intention is for a positive future for all. 

Wall Street paid for ad is a fraud just like Crooked Hillary! Their main line had nothing to do with women and they knew it. Apologize?

Do you think Crooked Hillary will finally close the deal? If she can't win Kentucky she should drop out of race. System rigged! 

I look forward to watching Megan Kelly. It will be interesting to see how she treats me. I think she will be very fair.

How can Crooked Hillary put her husband in charge of the economy when he was responsible for NAFTA the worst economic deal in U.S. history?

Crooked Hillary said her husband is going to be in charge of the economy.If so he should runnot her.Will he bring the "energizer" to D.C.?

Crooked Hillary can't close the deal with Bernie Sanders. Will be another bad day for her!

Amazing that Crooked Hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the WORST abuser of woman in U.S. political history

Oregon is voting today. Keep the big numbers going - VOTE TRUMP! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women. Can't believe she would misrepresent the facts! My hit was on China

The pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. "You can tell them to go BLANK themselves" - was about China NOT WOMEN!

Wow 30000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar! How can she run?

Wow 30000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar! How can she run?

What Barbara Res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly and for years trying to come back. I said no.

I gave a woman named Barbara Res a top N.Y. construction job when that was unheard of and now she is nasty. So much for a nice thank you!

In politics and in life ignorance is not a virtue." This is a primary reason that President Obama is the worst president in U.S. history!

The writer of the now proven false story in the New York Times Michael Barbaro who was interviewed on CBS this morning was unable to respond.

Over 50 women were interviewed by the New York Times yet they only wrote about 6. Thats because there were so many positive statements.

No wonder the New York Times is failing who can believe what they write after the false malicious & libelous story they did on me.

The failing New York Times is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women. 

With the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing New York Times hit piece on me we have exposed the article as a fraud!

A political commentator for CNN which I no longer watch said "Trump showed some weakness in the Repub Primaries." I set all-time record!

The New York Times is so dishonest. Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer who said it was a lie!

That was an amazing interview on Fox and Friends - I hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the New York Times is!

Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Dems. The system is rigged against him. He should run as an independent! Run Bernie run.

The Washington Post report on potential VP candidates is wrong. Marco Rubio and most others mentioned are NOT under consideration.

Thank you Georgia! See you soon! #Trump2016 

The media is really on a witch-hunt against me. False reporting and plenty of it - but we will prevail!

Why did the failing New York Times refuse to use any of the names given to them that I was so proud to have helped with their careers. DISHONEST!

Wow I have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing New York Times piece. Massive front page for that!

Why doesn't the failing New York Times write the real story on the Clintons and women? The media is TOTALLY dishonest!

New York Times keep shining....the ppl will not let the media dim your light...we no longer believe them! #Trump2016" Thanks.

Everyone continues to pile onto me but they can NEVER take away our votes!"  Thank you!

Everyone is laughing at the New York Times for the lame hit piece they did on me and women.I gave them many names of women I helped-refused to use

OHIO WOMEN FOR TRUMP 

OHIO WOMEN FOR TRUMP 

OHIO WOMEN FOR TRUMP 

OHIO WOMEN FOR TRUMP 

We seem to have the same trajectory both were written off but they keep scaling the heights. History?

The failing New York Times wrote yet another hit piece on me. All are impressed with how nicely I have treated women they found nothing. A joke!

Wow CNN is really working hard to make me look as bad  as possible. Very unprofessional. Hurting in ratings - bad television! Great new poll- thank you! 

If Crooked Hillary Clinton can't close the deal on Crazy Bernie how is she going to take on China Russia ISIS and all of the others?

An incredible honor to receive the endorsement of a person I have such tremendous respect for. Thank you Sheldon! 

Your story about me & the carbon tax is absolutely incorrect. It is just the opposite. I will not support or endorse a carbon tax!

Senator Lindsey Graham called me yesterday very much to my surprise and we had a very interesting talk about national security and more!

If it were up to goofy Elizabeth Warren wed have no jobs in Americashe doesnt have a clue.

In interview I told AP that my taxes are under routine audit and I would release my tax returns when audit is complete not after election!

Isnt it funny when a failed Senator like goofy Elizabeth Warren can spend a whole day tweeting about Trump & gets nothing done in Senate?

Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage. See mediaasking for increase!

Our Native American Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren couldnt care less about the American workerdoes nothing to help!

Goofy Elizabeth Warren is now using the womans card like her friend crooked Hillary. See her dumb tweet when a woman stands up to you

If the people of Massachusetts found out what an ineffective Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren has been she would lose! Thanks Piers. 

'Duck Dynasty' star Phil Robertson says he'll back Trump for president 

Goofy Elizabeth Warren didnt have the guts to run for POTUS. Her phony Native American heritage stops that and VP cold.

Goofy Elizabeth Warren has been one of the least effective Senators in the entire U.S. Senate. She has done nothing!

I don't want to hit Crazy Bernie Sanders too hard yet because I love watching what he is doing to Crooked Hillary. His time will come!

Big wins in West Virginia and Nebraska. Get ready for November - Crooked Hillary who is looking very bad against Crazy Bernie will lose!

The Clintons spend millions on negative ads on me & I cant tell the truth about her husband? Dont feel sorry for crooked Hillary!

Hillary has bad judgment! 

It was so great being in Nebraska last week. Today is the big day--get out and vote!

I look very much forward to meeting w/Paul Ryan & the GOP Party Leadership on Thurs in DC. Together we will beat the Dems at all levels!

It is only the people that were never asked to be VP that tell the press that they will not take the position.

It was Rosie O'Donnell who ate the cake in the vicious Hillary commercial about me not Crooked Hillary!

Why does the media with a strong push from Crooked Hillary keep pushing the false narrative that I want to raise taxes. Exactly opposite!

Great job on Fox and Friends this morning. Thank you for the nice words!

For Our Children: Let's Elect Donald Trump 

I am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate. Any negotiated increase by Congress to my proposal would still be lower than current!

I will have set the all time record in primary votes in the Republican party --despite having to compete against 17 other people!

If I only had 1 person running against me in the primaries like Hillary Clinton I would have gotten 10 million more votes than she did!

Crooked Hillary Clinton says that she got more primary votes than Donald Trump. But I had 17 people to beatshe had one!  A nasty guy with no heart!

Is Chris serious lying or misinformed? Bill Clinton signed NAFTA. 

The liars that signed the pledge and now won't support me. The reason they are losers. A nasty guy with no heart!

Wow I hear Morning Joe has gone really hostile ever since I said I won't do or watch the show anymore.They misrepresent my positions!

Russell Moore is truly a terrible representative of Evangelicals and all of the good they stand for. A nasty guy with no heart!


Crooked Hillary just can't close the deal with Bernie. It will be the same way with ISIS and China on trade and Mexico at the border. Bad!

Kellyanne you were fantastic on Meet The Press today. Keep going - I will win for the people. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! HappyMothersDay!  

Kellyanne you were fantastic on Meet The Press today. Keep going - I will win for the people. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! HappyMothersDay! 

Kellyanne you were fantastic on Meet The Press today. Keep going - I will win for the people. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! HappyMothersDay! 

I want a leader that will shoot straight with us. The politicians can't.

Remember when the two failed presidential candidates Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush signed a binding PLEDGE? They broke the deal no honor!

I am honored that the great men and women of the @Teamsters have created a movement from within called Teamsters for Trump! Thank you.

I am going to keep our jobs in the U.S. and totally rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. Crooked Hillary has no clue! @Teamsters

Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk no action -- maybe her Native American name?

Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts.

Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me.

Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant but leaves behind amazing legacy.

Goofy Elizabeth Warren Hillary Clintons flunky has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American.

Lets properly check goofy Elizabeth Warrens records to see if she is Native American. I say shes a fraud!

I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.

I hear JoeNBC of rapidly fading Morning_Joe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run. This will guarantee a Crooked Hillary win.

Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed then John Kasich and that didn't work. Not much power or insight!

Thank you to teachers across America! When I become POTUS we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now.

Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability. As Bernie Sanders says she has bad judgement. Constantly playing the women's card - it is sad!

Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special the Republican Party. Wrong I didn't inherit it I won it with millions of voters! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill.

Many would say that you are the only talented person running for the top job this time!

So many great endorsements yesterday except for Paul Ryan! We must put America first and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill.

Governor Rick Perry said "Donald Trump is one of the most talented people running for the Presidency I've ever seen." Thank you Rick!

Unlike crooked Hillary Clinton who wants to destroy all miners I want wages to go up in America. We will do so by bringing back jobs! I love Hispanics! 

Thank you West Virginia. Let's keep it going. Go out and vote on Tuesday - we will win big. #Trump2016

Can you believe Crooked Hillary said "We are going to put a whole lot of coal miners&coal companies out of business." She then apologized. I love Hispanics! 

Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats. Both with delegates & otherwise. He should show them & run as an Independent.

Happy #CincoDeMayo! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! 

I love Hispanics!

I love Hispanics! 

I love Hispanics! 

I will be interviewed by @BretBaier @SpecialReport at 6pm ET tonight @FoxNews

Many reports that I will be attending the Alvarez/Khan fight this weekend in Vegas. Totally untrue! Unfortunately I have other plans.

The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill.

I would rather run against Crooked Hillary Clinton than Bernie Sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against Bernie!

What a great evening we had. So interesting that Sanders beat Crooked Hillary. The dysfunctional system is totally rigged against him!

Please correct I WON Virginia!

Thank you Indiana we were just projected to be the winner. We have won in every category. You are very special people-I will never forget!

Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will and must win Indiana. If he doesn't he should drop out of the race-stop wasting time & money.

Wow Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure - not very presidential. Sad!

I will be campaigning in Indiana all day. Things are looking great and the support of Bobby Knight has been so amazing. Today will be fun!

Everybody is talking about the protesters burning the American flags and proudly waving Mexican flags. I want America First - so do voters!

Gov Mike Pence has just stated that Donald Trump has taken a strong stance on Hoosier jobs and he thanks me! I will bring back jobs to USA.

Crooked Hillary Clinton said she is used to "dealing with men who get off the reservation." Actually she has done poorly with such men!

Karl Rove is a failed Jeb Bushy. Never says anything good & never will even after I beat Hillary. Shouldn't be on the air!

I am on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace- his 20th year anniversary with Fox News! 

I watched Sen. Graham Face The Nation. Why don't they say that I ran him out of the race like a little boy and in the end he had no support? Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will and must win Indiana. If he doesn't he should drop out of the race-stop wasting time & money.

Wow Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure - not very presidential. Sad! 

The economy is bad and getting worse-almost ZERO growth this quarter. Nobody can beat me on the economy (and jobs). MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

The "protesters" in California were thugs and criminals. Many are professionals. They should be dealt with strongly by law enforcement!

Anderson so amazing. Your mother is and always has been an incredible woman!

We are now at 1001 delegates. We will win on the first ballot and are not wasting time and effort on other ballots because system is rigged!

Crooked Hillary Clinton perhaps the most dishonest person to have ever run for the presidency is also one of the all time great enablers!

Wow the ridiculous deal made between Lyin'Ted Cruz and 1 for 42 John Kasich has just blown up. What a dumb deal - dead on arrival!

New York Yankees President Randy Levine: 'End of the Republican Party' If Donald Trump Not Nominated.   

So many false and phony T.V. commercials being broadcast in Indiana. Reminds me of Florida where thousands were put up-I won in a landslide!

I will be in Evansville Indiana with the great Bobby Knight (who last night endorsed me) at 12:00 this afternoon. See you there!

Lyin' Ted Cruz who can never beat Hillary Clinton and has NO path to victory has chosen a V.P.candidate who failed badly in her own effort

Thank you to all for the wonderful reviews of my foreign policy speech. I will soon be speaking in great detail on numerous other topics!

Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will and must win Indiana. If he doesn't he should drop out of the race-stop wasting time & money.

Wow Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure - not very presidential. Sad!

I cried when they said you made a clean sweep of all 5 states. I was SO HAPPY!

Getting the strong endorsement of the great coach Bobby Knight has been a highlight of my stay in Indiana. Big speech tomorrow with Bobby!

I am in Indiana where we just had a great rally. Fantastic people! Staying at a Holiday Inn Express - new and clean not bad! Thank you Laura!  

Thank you for the endorsement Coach Bobby Knight! I will never forget it! Thank you Newt! Thanks Dave! 

GREATEST FOREIGN POLICY SPEECH SINCE WASHINGTON'S FAREWELL ADDRESS.

Lets #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Maryland! #VoteTrump  

How bad is the New York Times the most inaccurate coverage constantly. Always trying to belittle. Paper has lost its way!

Thank you for the incredible support- Melania Barron Ivanka Jared Tiffany Don Vanessa Eric and Lara! 

Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democratsboth with delegates & otherwise. He should show them and run as an Independent! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

The Cruz-Kasich pact is under great strain. This joke of a deal is falling apart not being honored and almost dead. Very dumb!

Passing what was once a vibrant manufacturing area in Pennsylvania. So sad! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  

On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night!

Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work.

Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.

Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!

Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!

Wow just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!

I am happy to hear how badly the New York Times is doing. It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down. Becoming irrelevant!

I will be in Maryland this afternoon for a major rally. Things are looking good for Tuesday!

As soon as John Kasich is hit with negative ads he will drop like a rock in the polls against Crooked Hillary Clinton. I will win!

I had a great day campaigning in Connecticut. Looking for a big vote on Tuesday!

Congratulations to Sean Hannity on his great ratings and ratings increase as reported by the AP today. Amazing job!

Lynne Ryan -- just read your great story in the NY Times -- I am proud of you. Thanks! 

Cast your vote for Trump for POTUS & ALSO vote for the TRUMP DELEGATES in your congressional district! 

Will be spending the day campaigning in Connecticut another state where jobs are being stolen by other countries. I will stop this fast!

I met Prince on numerous occasions. He was an amazing talent and wonderful guy. He will be greatly missed!

Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted.

Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!

Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!

Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!

I will be doing the @TODAYshow with my wife Melania and the rest of my family in a major Town Hall. Hopefully it will be fun! Enjoy.7A.M.

We are going to bring steel and manufacturing back to Indiana!

Had a meeting with the terrific @GovPenceIN of Indiana. So excited to campaign in his wonderful state! 

Ted Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race. Now all he can do is be a spoiler never a nice thing to do. I will beat Hillary! 

CNN is so negative it is impossible to watch. Terrible panel angry haters.    

1988 with Oprah, I discuss why I would never rule out a run for POTUS.

Who did the House Task Force on Urgent Fiscal Issues call- when America needed HELP?  

Lyin Ted Cruz even voted against Superstorm Sandy aid and September 11th help. So many New Yorkers devastated. Cruz hates New York!

New York we will make America great again! 

Kasich only looks O.K. in polls against Hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed ZERO negative ads against him

Lyin' Ted Cruz can't win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bosses-I am millions of VOTES ahead! Hillary would destroy him & Kasich

I will fix this corrupted rigged system. 4 no Profit Under budget & ahead of schedule.

I would have millions of votes more than Hillary except for the fact that I had 17 opponents and she just had a socialist named Bernie!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. I am the one person she doesn't want to run against. Will be such fun!

Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses. It won't work!

Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary. Despite a rigged delegate system I am hundreds of delegates ahead of him.

I'll be in one of my favorite places this morning Staten Island. Big crowd will be fun!

New CBS Poll shows defections from Cruz's core supporters & increased support for me. Not surprising.

I'm starting to believe that I'm actually going to WIN!

Just arrived in Syracuse NY. Big crowd great place! We will bring back the desperately needed jobs. #NYPrimary 

We are becoming a third world country because of jerks like him" Great! We are becoming a third world country because of jerks like him" Great!

We are becoming a third world country because of jerks like him" Great! Finally someone who actually cares about us!! 

Big protest march in Colorado on Friday afternoon! Don't let the bosses take your vote!

The rules DID CHANGE in Colorado shortly after I entered the race in June because the pols and their bosses knew I would win with the voters

Biggest story in politics is now happening in the great State of Colorado where over one million people have been precluded from voting!

Missouri just confirmed #Trump2016 as the official winner- with an additional 12 delegates. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

Leaving for Albany New York now massive crowd expected. Very exciting!

Why does the liberal media think Bill O'Reilly is a complete and total vulgarian? I don't think so!

Why does the liberal media think Bill O'Reilly is a complete and total vulgarian? I don't think so!

Colorado Trump Delegates Scratched from Ballots at GOP Convention 

This is happening all over our countrygreat people being disenfranchised by politicians. Repub party is in trouble! 

The people of Colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians. Biggest story in politics. This will not be allowed!

How is it possible that the people of the great State of Colorado never got to vote in the Republican Primary? Great anger - totally unfair!

I win a state in votes and then get non-representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign. Bad system!

The New York Times purposely covers me so inaccurately. I want other nations to pay the U.S. for our defense of them. We are the suckers-no more!

New Jersey Man Joseph Hornick Willing to Go to Jail for Flying Trump Flag

GOP is trying to steal nomination from the winner not block an insurgent catching up 2 frontrunner (Sanders).

I am the only person who can save us from this corrupt political mess. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Women love Mr Trump too. Will make it happen in New York on April 19. Go out & vote.

Bernie Sanders says that Hillary Clinton is unqualified to be president. Based on her decision making ability I can go along with that!

Isn't it a shame that the person who will have by far the most delegates and many millions more votes than anyone else me still must fight

Trump will be our best president since Reagan! Nobody beats me on National Security. Looks like I was right about NATO. I had no doubt. 

Jennifer is a terrific person. Trump Cruz is hated in New York. He should go home - no place for a phony. Ted Cruz attacked New Yorkers and New York values- we don't forget! 

Jennifer is a terrific person. Trump Cruz is hated in New York. He should go home - no place for a phony. Ted Cruz attacked New Yorkers and New York values- we don't forget! 

Unbelievable evening. Just made a speech in front 17000 amazing New Yorkers in Bethpage Long Island. Great to be home! Pure fiction!

It is so great to be back home! Looking forward to a great rally tonight in Bethpage Long Island!

Wow Politico is in total disarray  with almost everybody quitting. Good news. Bad dishonest journalists! 

DonaldTrump is the only guy I think that has the will & the nerve to attack & to fight. 

VERY close to my heart. I'm a NAVY VET! I love VETERANS ADMINISTRATION REFORMS. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Wow great news from Wisconsin. Just made two speeches there with a big one coming tonight. Thank you! 

A great day in Wisconsin many stops many great people! Melania is joining me on Monday. Big crowds. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I don't care about the game I care about the PEOPLE. And that's exactly why WE THE PEOPLE love you so much! #Trump2016

CNN is reviewing the weekbut majority of the show about me because there would be 0.0 ratings if not. Media's a JOKE. Enjoy!

Thank you for your nice words on Fox today. They never use my full statements on nuclear which you would agree with!

Great honor to have GOP General Counsel John Ryder as a Trump delegate in TN. RNC meeting well worth it! Unifying the party!

Wisconsin has suffered a great loss of jobs and trade but if I win all of the bad things happening in the U.S. will be rapidly reversed!

I will be in Wisconsin until the election. Jobs trade and immigration will be big factors. I will bring jobs back home - make great deals!

If Megan Kelly stopped covering me on her show her ratings would drop like a rock! My h to h interview with Anderson Cooper beat her by millions! Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? 

Is it possible for Megan Kelly to cover anyone but Donald Trump on her terrible show. She totally misrepresents my words and positions! BAD. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! BAD.

Can you believe that Ted Cruz who has been killing our country on trade for so long just put out a Wisconsin ad talking about trade? We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States! 

We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States!

We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States!

We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States! We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States! Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? 

For the 1st time in American history Americas 16500 border patrol agents have issue a presidential primary endorsementme! Thank you.

The National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) said that our open border is the biggest physical & economic threat facing the American people! Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? 

The Club For Growth said in their ad that 465 delegates (Cruz) plus 143 delegates (Kasich) is more than my 739 delegates. Try again! Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? 

The Club For Growth which asked me for $10000 in an extortion attempt just put up a Wisconsin ad with incorrect math.What a dumb group! Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? 

Just had a very nice meeting with Reince Priebus and the @GOP. Looking forward to bringing the Party together and it will happen! The Trump Doctrine: Peace Through Strength. Nothing you say will change my mind! Congratulations to CNN for having the wisdom to pick TRUMP! 

Nice piece and video today in the Wall Street Journal: Trumps three eldest children jump into campaign 

David Gregory got thrown off of TV by NBC fired like a dog! Now he is on CNN being nasty to me. Not nice!

Final numbers's just announced in the GREAT State of MO. TRUMP WINS! New certified #'s show a 365 vote increase for me- @ least 12 more delegates!

This was the reporters statement- when she found out there was tape from my facility she changed her tune. 

Victory press conference was over.  Why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions? Can I press charges? 

Why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened that is before she found out the episode was on tape?

Wow Corey Lewandowski my campaign manager and a very decent man was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there!

How come the @TODAYshow & @chucktodd show the new @NBCNews Poll for Hillary vs Bernie but do not show the SAME poll where I am killing Cruz?

I have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC.

Wow CNN has nothing but my opponents on their shows. Really one-sided and unfair reporting. Maybe I shouldn't do their town-hall tonight!

We need to secure our borders ASAP. No games we must be smart tough and vigilant. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN & MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN!

Lyin' Ted I have already beaten you in all debates and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates. You should focus on jobs & illegal imm!

Lyin'Ted Cruz is weak & losing big so now he wants to debate again. But according to DrudgeTime and on-line polls I have won all debates

After the way I beat Gov. Scott Walker (and Jeb Rand Marco and all others) in the Presidential Primaries no way he would ever endorse me!

Cruz will say anything that is contrary to what you have to say. If you're for Motherhood he'll be against it!

Just released that international gangs are all over our cities. This will end when I am President!

Ted Cruz is incensed that I want to refocus NATO on terrorism as well as current mission but also want others to PAY FAIR SHARE a must!

A detainee released from Gitmo has killed an American. When will our so-called "leaders" ever learn!

The United States cannot continue to make such bad one-sided trade deals. There are only so many jobs we can give up. No more!

See Lyin' Ted even the DailyBeast says this story came from Rubio not Trump! 

Just to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than Cruz-Lawsuit coming

Why can't the pundits be honest? Hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again. I will make it strong and great!  JOBS!

Another radical Islamic attack this time in Pakistan targeting Christian women & children. At least 67 dead400 injured. I alone can solve

Happy Easter to all have a great day!

My statement on NATO being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive (and unfair) for the U.S. are now finally receiving plaudits!

Wow sleepy eyes Chuck Todd is at it again. He is do totally biased. The things I am saying are correct. - far better vision than the others

Remember I am the only candidate who is self-funding. While I am given little credit for this by the voters I am not bought like others!

Don't believe the Fox News Polls they are just another phony hit job on me. I will beat Hillary Clinton easily in the General Election.

Wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in U.S. jobs are leaving. I will make our economy strong again - bring in jobs

Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J. Trump. Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong. Illegals out!

Lyin' Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enq.were caused by me. I had NOTHING to do with story!

The press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women when they know that it is just the opposite!

The media is so after me on women  Wow this is a tough business. Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump!

Your instincts on foreign policy & terrorism have been better than all of these so called experienced politicians combined.

Top suspect in Paris massacre Salah Abdeslam who also knew of the Brussels attack is no longer talking. Weak leaders ridiculous laws!

Lyin Ted blames me for so many things I am starting to think he is having a mental health crisis.

Wow just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me. How am I still number one - by a lot?

I didn't start the fight with Lyin'Ted Cruz over the GQ cover pic of Melania he did. He knew the PAC was putting it out - hence Lyin' Ted!

Just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the Trump U case but the press refuses to write about it. If I lost-monster story! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Europe and the U.S. must immediately stop taking in people from Syria. This will be the destruction of civilization as we know it! So sad!

Just announced that as many as 5000 ISIS fighters have infiltrated Europe. Also many in U.S.  I TOLD YOU SO! I alone can fix this problem!

They're all brain-dead puppets with skeletons in their closet. I say you go on and destroy them all" A dead show

Explain how the women on The View which is a total disaster since the great Barbara Walters left ever got their jobs. @abc is wasting time

It is amazing how often I am right only to be criticized by the media. Illegal immigration take the oil build the wall Muslims NATO!

Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a "hell hole" and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article. I was so right!

These politicians like Cruz and Graham who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years do nothing to make things better!

Lindsay Graham and Lyin' Ted Cruz are two politicians who are very much alike - ALL TALK AND NO ACTION! Both talk about ISIS do nothing!

It is amazing how Lindsey Graham gets on so many T.V. shows talking negatively about me when I beat him so badly in his pres run!

Thank God is not a politician but he's one heck of a fighter who will fight for us the people.

We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of N.A.T.O. Why? It is time to renegotiate and the time is now!

N.A.T.O. is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on!

I want to thank Joe for all of his help in our historic Arizona win. Could not have done it without you Joe!

While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race!

I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted. Jeb spent more than $1500000 and got nothing. I spent a fraction of that and am first!

I will be the best by far in fighting terror. Im the only one that was right from the beginning & now Lyin Ted & others are copying me.

Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror. Shes been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are!

Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates Lyin Ted Cruz. Honestly I cant blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion!

Lyin Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me and lines from Michael Douglas just another dishonest politician.

Thank you Arizona! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpTrain 

Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania. That's why we call him Lyin' Ted!

Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices!

Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona. Thank you I will never forget!

Incompetent Hillary despite the horrible attack in Brussels today wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in.  No way!

Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful Lyin' Ted or I will spill the beans on your wife!

Pres. Obama should leave the baseball game in Cuba immediately & get home to Washington- where a #POTUS under a serious emergency belongs!

Obama and all others have been so weak and so politically correct that terror groups are forming and getting stronger! Shame.

My heart & prayers go out to all of the victims of the terrible Brussels tragedy. This madness must be stopped and I will stop it.

Watch this clip from earlier this year. Time & time again I have been right about terrorism. Its time to get tough! 

I have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody- and its not even close. Hopefully AZ and UT will be voting for me today!

President Obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in Cuba especially in the shadows of Brussels. He is being treated badly!

Do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place Brussels was. Not anymore it is from a different world! U.S. must be vigilant and smart! The media is corrupt! We The People are fighting with you.

Wow President Obama just landed in Cuba a big deal and Raul Castro wasn't even there to greet him. He greeted Pope and others. No respect

So the highly overrated anchor Megan Kelly is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show but I can't fight back? Wrong!

The protesters blocked a major highway yesterday delaying entry to my RALLY in Arizona by hours and the media blames my supporters!

Why is it that the horrendous protesters who scream curse punch shut down roads/doors during my RALLIES  are never blamed by media? SAD!

The rallies in Utah and Arizona were great! Tremendous crowds and spirit. Just returned but will be going back soon.

You are a true journalistic professional. I so agree with what you say. Keep up the great work! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Watching your show from Arizona where we just had a big rally. It is fantastic- everybody loves it!

Wow @CNN ratings are up 75% because it's "all Trump all the time." The networks are making a fortune off of me! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

If crazy Megan Kelly didn't cover me so much on her terrible show her ratings would totally tank. She is so average in so many ways!

Crazy Megan Kelly says I don't (won't) go on her show and she still gets good ratings. But almost all of her shows are negative hits on me! LYIN' TED 

Honored to be in Utah with retired General Robert C. Oaks. We are so thankful for his support and endorsement here.

Reading New York times is a total waste of time he is a clown with no awareness of the world around him- dummy!

While I have never met New York Times of the NY Times I consider him one of the dumbest of all pundits- he has no sense of the real world!

Just leaving Salt Lake City Utah- fantastic crowd with no interruptions.  Love Utah. I will be back! Utah Speaker of the House announces endorses me! 

Why haven't they released the final Missouri victory for us yet? Could it be because Cruz's guy runs Missouri?

I guess I have reached yet another "ceiling"  - 49.7% with four people. My highest Reuters poll yet! Thank you! 

Do you believe that Hillary Clinton now wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants? She should spend more time taking care of our great Vets! LYIN' TED 

Everybody should boycott the Megan Kelly show. Never worth watching. Always a hit on Trump! She is sick & the most overrated person on tv.

Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost! Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary

Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost! Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary

Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost! Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary

Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney was campaigning with John Kasich & Marco Rubio and now he is endorsing Ted Cruz. 1/2

Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney the man who "choked" and let us all down is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz. This is good for me!

Going to Salt Lake City Utah for a big rally. Lyin' Ted Cruz should not be allowed to win there.  Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary. Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary

Club for Growth letter- trying to extort $10000.00 from me. Remember I said- NO! 

Club For Growth tried to extort $10000 from me. When I said NO they went hostile with negative ads. Disgraceful!

With millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment my numbers continue to go up. Can anyone explain this?

Eric Erickson got fired like a dog from RedState and now he is the one leading opposition against me.

Eric Erickson got fired like a dog from RedState and now he is the one leading opposition against me.

Eric Erickson got fired like a dog from RedState and now he is the one leading opposition against me.

Senator Lindsey Graham made horrible statements about Senator Ted Cruz  and then he endorsed him. No wonder nobody trusts politicians!

Lyin' Ted Cruz lost all five races on Tuesday-and he was just given the jinx - a Lindsey Graham endorsement. Also backed Jeb. Lindsey got 0!

Hillary Clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life!

Who should star in a reboot of Liar Liar- Hillary Clinton or Ted Cruz? Let me know. 

Highly overrated & crazy Megan Kelly is always complaining about Trump and yet she devotes her shows to me. Focus on others Megyn!

Looking like my 5 victories on Tuesday will be just as good as if I won Ohio. Two more days and Ohio was mine!

Please explain to the dummies at the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board that I love to debate and have won according to Drudge etc. all 11 of them!

Wall Street Journal is bad at math. The good news is nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore especially me!

The reason lyin' Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem! Wow just won Missouri!

Crazy Megan Kelly is now complaining that Bill did not defend her against me. Her bad show is a total hit piece on me.Tough!

Great news that FoxNews has cancelled the additional debate. How many times can the same people ask the same question? I beat Cruz debating. Wow just won Missouri!

Crazy Megan Kelly supposedly had lyin' Ted Cruz on her show last night. Ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse. Ted can't win!

Stuart Stevens the failed campaign manager of Mitt Romney's historic loss is now telling the Republican Party what to do with Trump. Sad! Wow just won Missouri!

RT @JohnStossel: I can skate here ONLY b/c @realdonaldtrump fixed this rink after NYC govt spent $13M but FAILED! Good for Trump! 

I am making a big speech the night of the @FoxNews debate but I wish everyone well. Yesterday was a big day for me with 5 wins!

Thank you to the Governor of Florida Rick Scott for your endorsement. I greatly appreciate your support! Thank you Little Marco I agree!

In the last 2 weeks I had $35M of negative ads against me in Florida & I won in a massive landslide. The establishment should save their money! Thank you Little Marco I agree!

Yesterday was five amazing victories. Lyin Ted Cruz had zero. Things are going very well! Is this what we want for a President? Thank you Little Marco I agree! 

I only wish my wonderful daughter Tiffany could have been with us at Mar-a-Lago for our great election victory. She is a winner! Thank you Little Marco I agree!

Can't watch Crazy Megyn anymore. Talks about me at 43% but never mentions that there are four people in race. With two people big & over!

If media wasn't so biased against me I would've won all of the delegates. Megan Kelly is trying so hard to bash me. Don't worry everyone is wise to Crazy Megyn!

Word is that despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads I had a massive victory in Florida. Numbers out soon!

A lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in Florida? Hope this is false.

I will bring our jobs back to the U.S. and keep our companies from leaving. Nobody else can do it. Our economy will "sing" again.

In presidential voting so far John Kasich is ZERO for 22. So why would he be a good candidate? Hillary would beat him I will beat Hillary!

Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico now losing Ford (and many others). Kasich is weak on illegal immigration. We need strong borders now!

Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. Remember him in second debate until I put him down.

Mathematically it is statistically impossible for Kasich to get to 1237. He would need 112% of the remaining delegates to beat me

North Carolina lost 300000 manufacturing jobs and Ohio lost 400000 since 2000. Going to Mexico etc. NO MORE IF I WIN WE WILL BRING BACK! LYIN' TED 

Don't reward Mitt Romney who let us all down in the last presidential race by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA open borders etc.). LYIN' TED 

Please remember I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists! LYIN' TED 

I will bring our jobs back to America fix our military and take care of our vets end Common Core and ObamaCare protect 2nd A build WALL

Rubio is weak on illegal immigration with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in many years. He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! LYIN' TED 

Kasich voted for NAFTA a disaster for Ohio and now wants the even worse TPP approved. Vote Trump and end this madness! Who started this mess the protesters of course . And media made it worse. LYIN' TED 

Sadly this kind of stuff even happened to Ronald Reagan. There is nothing nice about it! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain. Kasich has helped decimate the coal and steel industries in Ohio. I will bring them back! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Gov Kasich voted for NAFTA which devastated Ohio and is now pushing TPP hard- bad for American workers! LYIN' TED 

The failing @nytimes is truly one of the worst newspapers. They knowingly write lies and never even call to fact check. Really bad people!

Because Gov. Kasich cannot run in the state of Pennsylvania-he cannot win the nomination- & should not be allowed to compete in Ohio on Tue.

Carly Fiorina- I agree! Ted Cruz is just another politician. All talk- no action! LYIN' TED 

Thank you Kevin. With unification of the party Republican wins will be massive!  

Gov.Kasich of Ohio just stated on a morning show that he doesn't watch politics or anything on television he only watches the @GolfChannel

Ohio Gov.Kasich voted for NAFTA from which Ohio has never recovered. Now he wants TPP which will be even worse. Ohio steel and coal dying!

Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie or my supporters will go to yours!

Wow Kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of Pennsylvania not enough signatures. Big problem! LYIN' TED 

Chaos in Chicago was a planned attack. But Hillary insists it was a spontaneous reaction to an internet

USSS did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage. He has ties to ISIS. Should be in jail! 

Do the people of Ohio know that John Kasich is STRONGLY in favor of Common Core! In other words education of your children from D.C. No way!


Just finished my second speech. 20K in Dayton & 25K in Cleveland- perfectly behaved crowd. Thanks. I love you Ohio! 

It is Clinton and Sanders people who disrupted my rally in Chicago - and then they say I must talk to my people. Phony politicians!

The last person that Hillary or Bernie want to run against is Donald Trump and that is fact!

We are asking law enforcement to check for dishonest early voting in Florida- on behalf of little Marco Rubio.  No way to run a country!

Word is-early voting in FL is very dishonest. Little Marco his State Chairman & their minions are working overtime-trying to rig the vote. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

On my way to Dayton Ohio. Will be there soon!

The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled. Will be great - love you Ohio!

Ohio had the biggest budget increase in the U.S. If it were not for striking oil they would be bust! Governor Kasich in favor of TPP fraud!

Absentee Governor Kasich voted for NAFTA and NAFTA devastated Ohio - a disaster from which it never recovered. Kasich is good for Mexico!

The organized group of people many of them thugs who shut down our First Amendment rights in Chicago have totally energized America!

I just got off the phone with the great people of Guam! Thank you for your support! #VoteTrump today!

Great news! Thank you Governor Ralph DLG Torres! #Trump2016  

It means so much to me- receiving an endorsement from Phyllis Schlafly. A truly great woman & conservative. 

Thank you St. Louis Missouri!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Rumor has it that Politico is going out of business. Losing too much money. Great news! Likewise dopey Mort Zuckerman's. Dr. Ben Carson. I concur.

Probably with all pundits saying last fall I had no chance is that shows media so out of touch with Americans

Donald Trump is your man America. He is the best!! Vote for him!" Thank you!

Wow you are all correct about FoxNews - totally biased and disgusting reporting.

Remember I am the only one who is self-funding my campaign. All of the other candidates are bought and paid for by special interests!

Sun Sentinel says: Rubio lacks the experience work ethic and gravitas needed to be president. HE HAS NOT EARNED YOUR VOTE!

Michigan Mississippi Idaho & Hawaii: Get out to VOTE and join the movement today! Video: 

The Club for Growth is a very dishonest group. They represent conservative values terribly & are bad for America. 

People forget it was Club for Growth that asked me for $1 million. I said no & they went negative. Extortion!

I employ many people in Hawaii at my great hotel in Honolulu. Ill be there very soon. Vote for me Hawaii!

New ad concerning lightweight Senator Marco Rubio:  

Thank you Idaho! I love your potatoes-  nobody grows them better. As  President I will protect your market. 

Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio features Trump Univ. students in FL. attack ads- who submitted "excellent" reviews. 

It was great being in Michigan. Remember I am the only presidential candidate who will bring jobs back to the U.S.and protect car industry!

Don't believe the millions of dollars of phony television ads by lightweight Rubio and the R establishment. Dishonest people!

Leaving for North Carolina. Big crowd will be fun!

Congratulation to Adam Scott and all of the folks at Trump National Doral on producing a really great WGC Tournament. Amazing finish!

I will be using Facebook and Twitter to expose dishonest lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. A record no-show in Senate he is scamming Florida

We cannot let the failing REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT who could not stop Obama (twice) ruin the MOVEMENT with millions of  $'s in false ads!

Lindsey Graham is all over T.V. much like failed 47% candidate Mitt Romney. These nasty angry jealous  failures have ZERO credibility!

Failed presidential candidate Lindsey Graham should respect me. I destroyed his run brought him from 7% to 0% when he got out. Now nasty!

How do you fight millions of dollars of fraudulent commercials pushing for crooked politicians? I will be using Facebook & Twitter. Watch!

All of the phony T.V. commercials against me are bought and payed for by SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS the bandits that tell your pols what to do

I am at Trump National Doral-best resort in U.S. Rory and Adam Scott are doing great! Watch on NBC at 3:00 P.M.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Thank you to @jdickerson and @FaceTheNation for a very fair and professional interview this morning. No wonder you are #1 in the ratings!

Fraud lightweight Marco made a TV ad on TrumpU featuring 2 people who signed these letters: 

The primary plaintiff in the phony Trump University suit wants to abandon the case. Disgraceful!

Nancy Reagan the wife of a truly great President was an amazing woman. She will be missed!

David Brooks of the New York Times is closing in on being the dumbest of them all. He doesnt have a clue.

I am watching two clown announcers on Fox News as they try to build up failed presidential candidate Little Marco. Fox News is in the bag!

Romney's failed advisors like campaign mgr Stuart Stevens are all over TV telling people how to win. But they lost- don't know how to win!

Mitt Romney was a disaster candidate who had no guts and choked! Romney is a total joke and everyone knows it!

To the people of Kentucky  Rand Paul didn't want you. Now he runs back due to his presidential failure.  #VoteTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Why would anyone in Kentucky listen to failed presidential candidate Rand Paul re: caucus. Made a fool of himself (1%.) KY his 2nd choice! Wow big lines in Kansas.

For all of today's voters please remember that I am the only candidate that is self funding my campaign I am not bought and paid for!

Great time last night in Louisiana. Big and energetic crowd. Go out and vote now polls open. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I am in Kansas. Will be an exciting day. Big speech this morning in Wichita and then go to caucus. Sorry CPAC (the format was fine!). 

U.S. Senator Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) issued the following statement today regarding the 2016 presidential election:

The Better Business Bureau report with an A rating for Trump University. #GOPDebate 

Rubio puts out ad that my pilot was a drug dealer- not true not my pilot! Guy owned helicopter company- don't think I ever even used.

Senator Sessions will serve as the  Chairman of my National Security  Advisory Committee. 

People are just mad that you're doing so good so they are gonna do they're best to stop you. Not gonna happen #MAGA. Now Romney wants to do it again.

The phony lawsuit against Trump U could have been easily settled by me but I want  to go to court. 98% approval rating by students. Easy win

As predicted Trump reaching out to make peace with Republican "establishment".  If he becomes inevitable party would be

Why did Mitt Romney BEG me for my endorsement four years ago?

I am the only one who can beat Hillary Clinton. I am not a Mitt Romney who doesn't know how to win. Hillary wants no part of "Trump

Why would the great people of Florida vote for a guy who as a Senator never even shows up to vote - worst record. Marco Rubio is a joke!

I have brought millions of people into the Republican Party while the Dems are going down. Establishment wants to kill this movement!

Failed candidate Mitt Romneywho ran one of the worst races in presidential historyis working with the establishment to bury a big "R" win!

Looks like two-time failed candidate Mitt Romney is going to be telling Republicans how to get elected. Not a good messenger!

Millions of dollars being spent on false TV ads by special interest groups who own Rubio & Cruz.When you see them think of your puppet POLS

The establishment doesn't like me because they can't control me and get me to lie to you and keep ripping you off.

Because of me the Republican Party has taken in millions of new voters a record. If they are not careful they will all leave. Sad! I would love to see the Republican party and everyone get together- and unify.

Just another desperate move by the man who should have easily beaten Barrack Obama.

Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney is having a news conference tomorrow to criticize me. 

I am going to repeal and replace ObamaCare! Read more about my positions on healthcare reform here. Fox muppets!

CNN poll just hit 49% for Trump. Interesting how my numbers have gone so far up since lightweight Marco Rubio has turned nasty. Love it!

And you and the rest of you Fox muppets refuse to HEAR HIM.

Why can't the leaders of the Republican Party see that I am bringing in new voters by the millions-we are creating a larger stronger party! My wife MELANIA TRUMP! I took Trump University class and saved my home!

Marco Rubio lost big last night. I even beat him in Virginia where he spent so much time and money. Now his bosses are desperate and angry!

Why would anyone in Florida vote for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. Check out his credit card scam his house sale & his no show voting!

The special interests and people who control our politicians (puppets) are spending $25 million on misleading and fraudulent T.V. ads on me.

Got the endorsement of Brian France and NASCAR yesterday in Georgia. Also many of the sports great drivers. Thank you Nascar and Georgia!

Phylis Schlafly: 'Marco Rubio Betrayed Us All' 

Little Marco Rubio treated America's ICE officers "like absolute trash" in order to pass Obama's amnesty. 

Little Marco Rubio gave amnesty to criminal aliens guilty of "sex offenses." DISGRACE! 

Little Marco Rubio is just another Washington D.C. politician that is all talk and no action. #RobotRubio 

Rubio was kicking back on his $80k boat he bought with lobbyist money and claimed it was from book sale profit lol

Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio is polling very poorly in Florida. The people can't stand him for missing so many votes - poor work ethic!

Little Marco Rubio the lightweight no show Senator from Florida is just another Washington politician. 

Mitt Romney didn't show his tax return until SEPTEMBER 212012 and then only after being humiliated by Harry R! A bad messenger for estab!

As I stated at the press conference on Friday regarding David Duke- I disavow. 

Why would the people of Texas support Ted Cruz when he has accomplished absolutely nothing for them. He is another all talk no action pol!

Little Marco Rubio the lightweight no show Senator from Florida is set to be the "puppet" of the special interest Koch brothers. WATCH!

Making a big speech in Alabama today. So many people we had to move to a football stadium! Come and join us!

I am the only Republican who will get large numbers of Dems and Indies (crossover). I will also get states that no other Republican can get.

While Hillary and I both won South Carolina by big margins Repubs got far more votes with a massive increase from past cycles.GROWING PARTY

The Republican Establishment has been pushing for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio to say anything to "hit" Trump.I signed the pledge-careful

While I hear the Koch brothers are in big financial trouble (oil) word is they have chosen little Marco Rubio the lightweight from Florida. A lot more water after this bombshell Rubio. You are an enemy of America.

It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep. It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.
It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.

It is a sad commentary little boy Marco Rubio can't win in his home state. Floridians despise him as a opportunist phony.

I started my business with very little and built it into a great company with some of the best real estate assets in the World. Amazing!

I only wish my wonderful father Fred gave me $200 million to start my business like lightweight Rubio says. He didn't - total fabrication!

Fun to watch the Democrats working so hard to win the great State of South Carolina when I just won the Republican version - amazing people!

I am self-funding my campaign and am therefore not controlled by the lobbyists and special interests like lightweight Rubio or Ted Cruz!

Tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit. After the audit no problem!

I unfairly get audited by the I.R.S. almost every single year. I have rich friends who never get audited. I wonder why?

A majority of evangelicals believe I am best equipped to save the country. #Greta

What I would do on my first day in office. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Never let them see you sweat! 

They don't like Rubio in Florida- he left them high and dry. Doesn't even show up for votes!

Lightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night. The problem is he is a choker and once a choker always a choker! Mr. Meltdown.

Wow every poll said I won the debate last night. Great honor!

Lightweight choker Marco Rubio looks like a little boy on stage. Not presidential material!

Lying Ted Cruz and lightweight choker  Marco Rubio teamed up last night in a last ditch effort to stop our great movement. They failed!

Will be at Fort Worth (Texas) Convention Center at 11:30 A.M. Big crowd - get there early! Big announcement to be made!

Why would the people of Florida vote for Marco Rubio when he defrauded them by agreeing to represent them as their Senator and then quit!

Have a good chance to win Texas on Tuesday. Cruz is a nasty guy not one Senate endorsement and despite talk gets nothing done. Loser!

I will be making a speech at 12:00 in Fort Worth Texas. Really big crowd expected. Will be talking about the debate last night-plus plus!

Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney was made to look like a fool by Senator Harry Reid & didn't release his tax returns.

FMR PRES of Mexico Vicente Fox horribly used the F word when discussing the wall. He must apologize! If I did that there would be a uproar!

Early on Ted Cruz said that if he didn't win South Carolina it's over. He didn't win- and lost to me in a landslide! Signing a recent tax return- isn't this ridiculous? 

Just for your info tax returns have 0 to do w/ someones net worth. I have already filed my financial statements w/ FEC. They are great!

Why doesnt Mitt Romney just endorse Marco Rubio already. Should have done it before NH or Nevada where he had a little sway. Too late now!

Mitt Romney who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics is now pushing me on tax returns. Dope!

Great new poll. Thank you Texas! #VoteTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

Ted Cruz is lying again. Polls are showing that I do beat Hillary Clinton head to head.

That's why we are angry. The Republican Establishment will not support you. You are who the American people want!

This Texan will be voting Trump March 1st. Cruz is a fake Texan!

Chris thank you so much for your wonderful endorsement. I will not let you down! 

When Ted Cruz quits the race and the field begins to clear I will get most of his votes - no problem!

Why would Texans vote for "liar" Ted Cruz when he was born in Canada lived there for 4 years-and remained a Canadian citizen until recently

When Mitt Romney asked me for my endorsement last time around he was so awkward and goofy that we all should have known he could not win! He's a fool!

Mitt Romney who totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool is now playing tough guy. He's a fool!

The polls show that I picked up many Jeb Bush supporters. That is how I got to 46%. When others drop out I will pick up more.  Sad but true. He's a fool! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

In all of television- the only one who said anything bad about last nights landslide victory-- was dopey @KarlRove. He should be fired!

I am self funding my campaign & don't owe anybody anything! I only owe it to the American people! 

I beat both Hillary and Bernie and I haven't even started on them yet!

MELANIA TRUMP did great on television this morning. Poised smart and strong with a big heart - so much to offer. We are all proud of you! 

Make sure you get on the Trump line and are not mislead by the Cruz people. They are bad! BE CAREFUL.

Very proud of what my father has accomplished in the past 7 months -Wishing him amazing luck and success tonight! #NVcaucus 

My wife Melania will be on Morning Joe tomorrow morning at 8:00.  

Club for Growth is the group that came to my office seeking $1 million dollars. I told them no and now they are doing negative ads.

Great. Just reported on Fox News that many people who supported JebBush are now supporting me. I knew that would happen pundits didn't!

Wow great Ohio poll. Shows me leading by 5 points beating K!

Unlike the other Republican candidates I will be in Nevada all day and night - I won't be fleeing in and out. I love & invest in Nevada!

I am growing the Republican Party tremendously - just look at the numbers way up! Democrats numbers are significantly down from years past.

TRUMP IS UNSTOPPABLE....HE IS WHAT COMMON SENSE AMERICANS WANT WHETHER REPUBLICAN INDEPENDENT OR A REAGAN DEMOCRAT.

Ed Rollins gets it. Was just on Fox News explaining how Trump wins the general election. Thank you Ed!

Ted Cruz lifts the Bible high into the air and then lies like a dog-over and over again! The Evangelicals in S.C. figured him out & said no!

Ted Cruz does not have the right "temperment" to be President. Look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm. BAD!

Wow was Ted Cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication. He used him as a scape goat-fired like a dog! Ted panicked.

Ted Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in S.C. He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration.

A big fat hit job on CNN tonight. A total waste of time to watch boring and biased. Said I would never run a dope!

Just watched the very incompetent Mitt Romney Campaign Strategist Stuart Stevens. Now I know why Mitt lost so badly. Stevens is a clown!

Ted Cruz should be disqualified from his fraudulent win in Iowa. Weak RNC and Republican leadership probably won't let this happen! Sad.

Just saw the phony ad by Cruz - totally false more dirty tricks. He got caught in so many lies - is this man crazy?

Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks. No wonder he has lost Evangelical support!

Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false - no basis in fact. Take ad down Ted. Biggest liar in politics!

Wow Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director. More dirty tricks!

It is so important to audit The Federal Reserve and yet Ted Cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done.

Thank you for your endorsement @paulteutulsr! #BikersForTrump #VoteTrumpNV Video: 

Many people are now saying I won South Carolina because of the last debate. I showed anger and the people of our country are very angry!

Florida starts early voting on March 5 extending to March 15. Absentee ballots have been sent out!

No matter what liar sleazeball says about Lyin Cruz in Tennessee. We have early voting.

I hear the Rickets family who own the Chicago Cubs are secretly spending $'s against me. They better be careful they have a lot to hide!

The reason that Ted Cruz lost the Evangelicals in S.C. is because he is a world class LIAR and Evangelicals do not like liars!

I am in Las Vegas at the best hotel (by far) Trump International. I will be working with my wonderful teams and volunteers to WIN Nevada!

A number of months ago I was not expected to win South CarolinaTed Cruz was and yet I won in a landslide - every group and category. WIN!

Just back from a dinner in West Hollywood: shocked the majority of the table was voting for Trump.

The failing WSJ Wall Street Journal should fire both its pollster and its Editorial Board. Seldom has a paper been so wrong.Totally biased!

I will be live on all of the major morning talk shows. Enjoy!

Thank you Sarah Palin for your amazing help and support. Big win leaving now for Atlanta and Nevada.The people of South Carolina got it!

What a great night. Thank you South Carolina a special place with truly amazing people! LOVE

People gave me no chance in South Carolina. Now it looks like a possible win. I would be happy with a one vote victory! (HOPE)

South Carolina voters have the future of our country in their hands. Vote now (today) and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Remember that Marco Rubio is very weak on illegal immigration. South Carolina needs strength as illegals and Syrians pour in. Don't allow it

I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go!

Trump expressed concerns months after the Iraq War began while 60% of Americans still supported the war. 
TheTrump phenomenon summed up: Leadership Fighter and Winner. Not a Liar 

I am the only candidate (in many years) who is self-funding his campaign. Lobbyists and $ interests totally control all other candidates! 
TheTrump phenomenon summed up: Leadership Fighter and Winner. Not a Liar 

FoxNews is really starting to campaign hard for marcorubio. #fairandbalancedmyass"  He is weak on illegal immigration!

TheTrump phenomenon summed up: Leadership Fighter and Winner. Not a Liar 

Lying #Ted Cruz just (on election day) came out with a sneak and sleazy Robocall. He holds up the Bible but in fact is a true lowlife pol!

I'm a Regan Dem and believe in your message! God bless you and your campaign!

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Just finished two major speeches in South Carolina. Big crowds great people. Going for a third now!

Boycott all Apple products  until such time as Apple gives cellphone info to authorities regarding radical Islamic terrorist couple from Cal

Hopefully others will follow suit. Our country needs & should demand security. It is time to get tough & be smart!

I use both iPhone & Samsung. If Apple doesn't give info to authorities on the terrorists I'll only be using Samsung until they give info.

I have built so many great & complicated projects creating tens of thousands of jobs-video: 

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016  

Remember Cruz and Bush gave us Roberts who upheld #ObamaCare twice! I am the only one who will #MAKEAMERICAGREATAGAIN!

Im self-funding and I am going to take care of the people  not the special interests and insurance companies like the other candidates.

I will replace it with private plans health savings accounts & allow purchasing across state lines. Maximum choice & freedom for consumer.

I was referring to a backstop for pre-existing conditions. I will eliminate the law in its entirety & replace it w/ something much better. I agree with Marco Rubio that Ted Cruz is a liar!

I was asked about healthcare by Anderson Cooper & have been consistent- I will repeal all of #ObamaCare including the mandate period.

I agree with Marco Rubio that Ted Cruz is a liar!

.@FoxNews is changing their  theme from "fair and balanced" to "unfair and unbalanced." But dying @WSJ is worse.Their phony poll is a  joke!

New CBS National Poll just out - massive lead for Trump. The Wall Street Journal/NBC Poll is a total joke. No wonder WSJ is doing so badly!

I love being in South Carolina. We are leading big in all of the State polls - Saturday is a BIG day. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

The just out USA Today National Poll where I lead by big numbers shows that in a head to head matchup I beat both Hillary and Bernie.

Amazing that while I lead by big numbers in the new Q and and USA Today polls the the press only wants to report on the phony WSJ/NBC poll.

Jeb Bush just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses. He wants to look cool but it's far too late. 1% in Nevada!

Just out Nevada poll shows Jeb Bush at 1% he should take his dumb mouthpiece @LindseyGrahamSC and just go home.

FoxNews is so biased it is disgusting. They do not want Trump to win. All negative!

I will beat Hillary easily but Lindsey Graham says I won't and yet he got zero against me- no cred! Why does FOX put him on?

He had zero in his presidential run before dropping out in disgrace- saying the most horrible things about me on FoxNews.

Interesting how President Obama so haltingly said I "would never be president" - This from perhaps the worst president in U.S. history!

Why does Megan Kelly devote so much time on her shows to me almost always negative?  Without me her ratings would tank. Get a life Megyn!

Explain to Megan Kelly who know nothing that I will beat Hillary and win states (and dem-indie votes) that no other can!

Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

New PPP Poll just out - Trump up big Cruz Rubio and Bush down. The debate results even with a stacked RNC audience were wonderful!

Spent the full day at meetings and a major rally yesterday in South Carolina. Great people and spirit. Today will be more of the same.

New South Carolina poll from PPP. Thank you! #VoteTrumpSC 

What a night! 10000 amazing supporters in Greenville South Carolina! THANK YOU! VOTE on Saturday! #VoteTrumpSC 

Thank you for your continued support! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

RESPONSE TO THE LIES OF SENATOR CRUZ: 

JEB is a hypocrite! Used massive private "Eminent Domain" --- Just another clueless politician!  

Jeb used Eminent Domain & took advantage of a disabled vet in the process. (2/2) 

I'd like to call JEB a liar but the truth is he has no clue & never revealed that he used Eminent Domain- when criticizing me! 

Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb(!) is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center Iraq War and eco collapse? Careful!

I will be in South Carolina all week. Saturday is BIG BIG BIG! Get out and vote - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates Hillary would destroy them. Ted may not be eligible to run - born in Canada

Funny that Jeb(!) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.Then mommy now brother! Thank you! I miss my father. 

Ted Cruz along with Jeb Bush pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court. Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice but didn't!

Wow in the new CBS Poll I went way up into the forties! Thank you!

Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists & special interests - the bosses!

Loved the debate last night and almost everyone said I won but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution. All donors & special ints

Thank you for your support! TOGETHER we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Thank you! I miss my father. 

I will be on Face the Nation with John Dickerson on CBS this morning. Enjoy! Thank you! I miss my father. 

This shows what a complete & total liar Ted Cruz is- he said he wouldn't have nominated John Roberts. Really? 

Jeb is incompetent and will lose don't waste your energy on that cry baby!

Jeb is incompetent and will lose don't waste your energy on that cry baby!

Jeb is incompetent and will lose don't waste your energy on that cry baby!

Jeb is incompetent and will lose don't waste your energy on that cry baby! Thank you! I miss my father. 

Even though every poll Time Drudge etc. has me winning the debate by a lot FoxNews only puts negative people on. Biased - a total joke! Thank you! I miss my father. 

Crushed the debate! Thank you! Thank you! I miss my father. 

Hey Glenn Beck. See how I beat your boy Ted- in your own Blaze poll? Your endorsement means nothing! 

All polls have me winning debate big- Drudge TIME etc. Dopey Charles Krauthammer still nasty. He has zero cred- totally dishonest!

How can Jeb Bush beat Hillary Clinton- if he can't beat anyone else on the GOPDebate stage with $150M? I am the only one who can! Thank you! I miss my father.  

Lightweight @JebBush said tonight he didn't know his family used private eminent domain in Texas- Lie!  #GOPDebate

On the way to the #GOPDebate with my wonderful wife @MelaniaTrump. 

Ted Cruz is a cheater! He holds the Bible high and then lies and misrepresents the facts!

Nasty Ted Cruz is at it again- same dirty tricks he used w/ @RealBenCarson- saying I may not be on ballot & I hold liberal positions. LIES!

Wow! Honored to be chosen by the highly respected + accurate Washington & Lee Mock Convention. I hope you are right - I will make you proud!

The totally unexpected loss of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is a massive setback for the Conservative movement and our COUNTRY!

Love the people of South Carolina - look very much forward to the debate tonight.

@AmFree: #Trump On #Ford #Carrier Shipping #Jobs To #Mexico: Im The Only One Who Understands Whats Going On 

@ThtsWhtKelSaid: I'm fed up w/ DC playing 3 card Monty w/ our tax $'s. It's time we the people play the Trump card & take back our country

@BrandonSawyer84: @realDonaldTrump will rule #SouthCarolinaPrimary! 

@wino911:  #Trump2016 We know better than to trust the RNC 

RT @EricTrump: Nevada: Reminder that today is the LAST day to register to vote in the February 23rd caucus!

Thank you South Carolina! We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN! 

Get on Trump's List" email from the RNC was not authorized. I am self funding my campaign! Do not pay.  Email: 

A very big thank you to Bill Donohue head of The Catholic League for the wonderful interview on @CNN and article in Newsmax! Great insight

Totally unauthorized do not pay. I am self funding my campaign! Notice has just been withdrawn. #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

The RNC which is probably not on my side just illegally put out a fundraising notice saying Trump wants you to contribute to the RNC.

Now an additional 600-700 jobs in America (2000) being eliminated for move to Mexico- via Hartford Courant. 

Nice column by Bill Donahue head of Catholic League. He's a blue collar New Yorker and gets it 

I am the only one who can fix this. Very sad. Will not happen under my watch! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  

Just got back from Tampa. It was an amazing evening with an even more amazing crowd - fantastic people! Will be in South Carolina tomorrow.

Word is that little Morty Zuckermans @NYDailyNews loses more than $50 million per year---can that be possible?

When little Morty Zuckerman closes his failing @NYDailyNews will I at least be given some credit? Will happen soon.

11000 inside venue tonight in Tampa! Broke record set by Elton John in 1988 w/out musical instruments! Another 5000 outside. Will be back!

I will end illegal immigration and protect our borders! We need to MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN! #Trump2016 

Millions of $'s of false ads  paid for by lobbyists-special interests of cheater @SenTedCruz  and sleepy @JebBush are now running in S.C.


Last time lightweight @JebBush tried to knock off @marcorubio he made a total fool of himself. If he doesn't do better this time he is out!

If TedCruz doesnt clean up his act stop cheating & doing negative ads I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen.

Lightweight JebBush is spending a fortune of special interest against me in SC. False advertising- desperate and sad!

After hearing the news that they would not be able to extort $1M from me they went hostile w/ a series of incorrect & ill-informed ads.

Nothing conservative about the Club for Growth coming into my office and demanding a $1M contribution which naturally they did not get.

You must be registered Republican by February 16th to vote TRUMP in the Florida primary. 

The failing NYDailyNews destroyed by little Morty Zuckerman is preparing to close and save face by going online. It's dead!

NEVADA! Tomorrow is the deadline to register Republican.  Visit: 

How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?

Lying Cruz put out a statement Trump & Rubio are w/Obama on gay marriage." Cruz is the worst liar crazy or very dishonest. Perhaps all 3?

Weak JEB getting thrown out by management during speech. Do you think he will be this tough on Putin & others?  

THANK YOU- Baton Rouge Louisiana! WE will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! #Trump2016 

Just landed in Baton Rouge Louisiana. Reports are out that lines are three quarters of a mile to get in. Wow! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Cruz caught cold in lie after denial of push polls like lies w/ RealBenCarson. How can he preach Christian values? 

Heading to Baton Rouge Louisiana for a speech. Expecting a very large crowd! See you soon. #Trump2016  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

We are getting reports from many voters that the Cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest "pushpolls" on me. We are watching!

Jeb failed as Jeb! He gave up and enlisted Mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of Iraq). Spent $120 million.Weak-no chance!

He (or she) who hesitates is lost: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Remember it was the Republican Party with the help of Conservatives that made so many promises to their base BUT DIDN'T KEEP THEM! Hi DT

Mark Halperin showed a focus group on Morning Joe me using a very bad word. I never said the word left an open blank. Please apologize!

Jeb Bush spent more than $400000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5 I spent $30000 to come in 1st. Big difference in capability!

There are no buyers for the worthless @NYDailyNews but little Mort Zuckerman is frantically looking. It is bleeding red ink - a total loser!

I have been consistent in my opposition to Common Core. Get rid of Common Core--- keep education local! I was referring to the fact that Jeb Bush wants to keep common core.

So funny Jeb Bush called me a "highly gifted politician and a great entertainer" - I assume that is a compliment!

Such a great experience in New Hampshire - amazing people! Will be leaving for a big event in South Carolina today.

Like the worthless NYDailyNews looks like Politico will be going out of business. Bad reporting- no money no cred!

Worthless NYDailyNews which dopey Mort Zuckerman is desperately trying to sell has no buyer! Liabilities are massive!

Dopey Mort Zuckerman owner of the worthless @NYDailyNews has a major inferiority complex. Paper will close soon!

My report card grades for the 2 New Hampshire winners: DonaldTrump A: v strong energy/close. BernieSanders B+: went too long

Thank you to the people of  New Hampshire I love you! Now off to South Carolina.

We will stop heroin and other drugs from coming into New Hampshire from our open southern border. We will build a WALL and have security.

We will immediately repeal and replace ObamaCare - and nobody can do that like me. We will save $'s and have much better healthcare!

ISIS is making big threats today - no respect for U.S.A. or our "leader" - If I win it will be a very different storywith very fast results

The polls are now showing that I am the best to win the GENERAL ELECTION. States that are never in play for Repubs will be won by me. Great!

No-one has done more for people with disabilities than me. I have spent many millions of dollars to help out-and am happy to have done so!

I know the "Governors" and Jeb Bush who has gone nasty with lies is by far the weakest of the lot. His family used private eminent domain!

Remember @JebBush wants COMMON CORE (education from D.C.) and is very weak on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ("come as act of love"). Not a leader!

Now that Bush has wasted $120 million of special interest money on his failed campaign he says he would end super PACs. Sad!

Today's third stop- Londonderry New Hampshire! Thank you! #FITN #VoteTrumpNH 

America needs strong leadership. Politicians can talk but they dont get things done. Video: 

Everybody is laughing at Jeb Bush-spent $100 million and is at bottom of pack. A pathetic figure!

Jeb Bush is desperate - strongly in favor of #CommonCore and very weak on illegal immigration.

Thank you for your support at this mornings Town Hall- in Salem New Hampshire. #FITN #NHPrimary 

Jeb Bush has zero communication skills so he spent a fortune of special interest money on a Super Bowl ad. He is a weak candidate!

My two wonderful sons Don and Eric will be on @foxandfriends at 7:02 - now! Enjoy.

So far the Super Bowl is very boring - not nearly as exciting as politics - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I am in New Hampshire having a great time! Loved the #GOPDebate last night! Everybody enjoy the Super Bowl. #SuperBowlSunday #SB50

Thank you- Plymouth New Hampshire! #FITN #NHPrimary 

Thank you Newt!  

We are going to have a big event at the Verizon Wireless Arena in Manchester New Hampshire! 5K+! Join us tomorrow: 

Great to meet everyone while having breakfast @ChezVachon this morning! 

Trump Kasich Jeb and Christie all had good nights. 

The New Hampshire drug epidemic must stop. If elected POTUS- I will create borders & the drugs will stop pouring in. 

Border agent: "We might as well abolish our immigration laws altogether" 

I said this was happening long ago- I will stop this immediately!  

It never ends!  

I told you so. Our country totally lost control of illegal immigration even with criminals.  

10000 people in South Carolina unbelievable evening! Will be in New Hampshire tomorrow- love it. 

Really dumb Cheri Jacobus. Begged my people for a job. Turned her down twice and she went hostile. Major loser zero credibility!

Donald Trump loves America! He loves Americans! He loves our Vets! #TrumpSupporters 

Watch: Donald Trump OWNS A Heckler Who Said Illegal Immigrants Are The Backbone Of America 

Why vote for Trump? Unlike politicians all talk Trumps talk materializes! He will make America great again

Join me at Clemson University on Wednesday February 10th! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

Heading to South Carolina really big crowd! Will be back in New Hampshire tomorrow. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Such great support in New Hampshire. So many people are working so hard to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!

I very much look forward to tomorrows debate in New Hampshireso many things to say so much at stake. It will be an incredible evening!

Live Free or Die: A motto for the whole country to follow. #NewHampshire #FITN #VoteTrumpNH  

Big storm in New Hampshire. Moved my event to Monday. Will be there next four days.

Join us Monday February 8th @ the Verizon Wireless Arena in Manchester New Hampshire! #FITN #NHPolitics #Trump2016 

I agree. Great businessman. I like your tone tonight! Keep it up & you'll have this Democrats vote.

I will be interviewed by Anderson Cooper at 8pm on @CNN from New Hampshire. Should be very interesting!

Taking a helicopter to New Hampshire boarding now. Amazing activity planned. New UMASS poll very nice! 

Politicians are trying to chip away at the 2nd Amendment. I wont let them take away our guns! #Trump2016 Watch: 

This is the Cruz voter violation certificate sent to everyone a misdemeanor at minimum. 

As per the show an even more serious Cruz charge is the fraudulent voter violation certificate sent to everyone.


Thank you. Ted Cruz should be immediately disqualified in Iowa with each candidate moving up one notch.

Sanders says he wants to run against me because he doesn't want to run against me. He would be so easy to beat!

THANK YOU to everyone in Little Rock Arkansas tonight! A record crowd of 12K. #Trump2016 

Stop the assault on American values. Stand w/ Trump to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! #VotersSpeak: 

Thank you New Hampshire! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #FITN 

Dr. Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for "deceit and dirty tricks and lies.

Cruz just lied again- I am and have been totally against #ObamaCare- repeal and replace!

The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!

This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #CruzFraud 

I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! @FoxNews

Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.

And finally Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie!

The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud

Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.

During primetime of the Iowa Caucus Cruz put out a release that RealBenCarson was quitting the race and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.

Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!

Great job on Don Lemon tonight. Begged us for a job. We said no and she went hostile. A real dummy! CNN

On my way to New Hampshire- expecting a big and spirited crowd!  #FITN #Trump2016  

Anybody who watched all of Ted Cruz's far too long rambling overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his Howard Dean moment!

The #CruzCrew prevailed! Smart for @MarcoRubio to keep his speech short & sweet. Ditto for @realDonaldTrump who was brie

I don't believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign the only one. I will keep doing but not worth it!

I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in New Hampshire. Big crowd

The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history!

Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz & Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honor

My experience in Iowa was a great one. I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place. Nice

So nice to get an endorsement from the founder and owner of Pizza Ranch in Iowa! A great guy and great places! #CaucusForTrump

It is time to take back our country- and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! #CaucusForTrump Video: 

I will be interviewed on Face The Nation with @jdickerson this morning. Enjoy!

I am in Iowa. Will be interviewed on This Week With G Stephanopoulos this morning. ENJOY!

If I would have done the last debate a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). Also VETS got $600

By not doing the failed poorly rated debate I was able to make the point of not allowing "unfairness" - while raising $60000 for VETS.

Wow just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me will repeal & replace. He lies!

Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans scam!

Ted Cruz is totally unelectable if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN!

I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife Melania. After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State!

The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters "in violation." They are now under investigation. Bad!

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  #IACaucus #CaucusForTrump 

#IACaucus #CaucusForTrump #iCaucused #iVoted 

I want to thank evangelical Christians for the warm embrace I've received on the campaign trail. Video: 

I will be in Iowa all day and until Tuesday morning. Finally after all these years of watching stupidity we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Hillary Clinton is a major national security risk. Not presidential material! 

Amazing that Ted Cruz can't even get a Senator like @BenSasse who is easy to endorse him. Not one Senator  is endorsing Canada Ted!

The great State of Nebraska can do much better than @BenSasse as your Senator. Saw him on @greta - totally ineffective. Wants paid for pols.

The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton. At a minimum how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president?

They say that if I participated in last nights Fox debate they would have had 12 million more & would have broken the all time record.

Getting ready to take off for Nashua New Hampshire. Big crowd will be there soon. Fun!

Iowa was amazing last night. The event could not have worked out better. We raised $60000 for our great vets. They were so happy & proud

Thank you for your interest & support during last nights #GOPDebate! #IACaucus finder: 

Good morning America! Thank you for all of your support in the latest Drudge poll! 

Thank you for the kind words tonight @OMAROSA. You were great! See you soon!

I will take care of the Veterans who have served this country so bravely. #ThankAVet Video: 

An unbelievable night in Iowa with our great Veterans! We raised $60000.00 while the politicians talked! #GOPDebate

Watching biased Charles @krauthammer a @FoxNews flunky who didn't know that I won every debate in particular- the last one. Check polls!

I hear that Lyin' Cruz's man Robert Mercer a good man is very angry because Cruz lied to him about liquidating his (Teds) holdings?

I just can't be bought!

The "debate" tonight will be a total disaster - low ratings with advertisers and advertising rates dropping like a rock. I hate to see this.

On Greta 87% of the people said they would not watch the debate if I'm not in it. Wow- what an honor!

FOX debate advertising rates falling like a rock! Tune into my special event for the Veterans at 9pm EST!

Thank you- Lexington South Carolina! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

It was the childishly written & taunting PR statement by Fox that made me not do the debate more so than lightweight reporter Megan Kelly.

I am self funding my campaign so I do not owe anything to lobbyists & special interests. Should I do the GOP debate? 

By not showing I'm owning entire event. 

Even though I beat him in the first six debates especially the last one Ted Cruz wants to debate me again. Can we do it in Canada?

Just got to listen to Rush Limbaugh - the guy is fantastic! Should I do the GOP debate? 

The statement put out yesterday by @FoxNews was a disgrace to good broadcasting and journalism. Who would ever say something so nasty & dumb. Should I do the GOP debate? 

I refuse to call Megyn Kelly a bimbo because that would not be politically correct. Instead I will only call her a lightweight reporter.

Pathetic attempt by Fox to try and build up ratings for the #GOPDebate. Without me they'd have no ratings!  

Should I do the GOP debate? 

Begged me to do an event while asking organizers for $100000 for himself a bad guy!

Great honor- Rev. Jerry Falwell Jr. of Liberty University one of the most respected religious leaders in our nation has just endorsed me! 

For the great people of Iowa find your IACaucus location.

Why doesn't phony  @bobvanderplaats tell his followers all the times he asked for him and his family to stay at my hotels-didn't like paying

I will end common core. It's a disaster. 

Donald Trump retains national lead in new ABC News/WaPo poll with 37%: 

Cruz lies are almost as bad as Jeb's. These politicians will do anything to stay at the trough!

Cruz going down fast in recent polls- dropping like a rock. Lies never work!

Ted Cruz is a nervous wreck. He is making reckless charges not caring for the truth! His poll #'s are way down!

I have a touched a nerve in our country in a way that most politicians have not been able to do. 

It's time for Ted Cruz to either settle his problem with the FACT that he was born in Canada and was a citizen of Canada or get out of race

Trump +15 on Cruz in 2 weeks. Cruz may look back and ask why he ever attacked Trump. DT has killed him ever since. Love making correct predictions. National Review is over.

Fox News Poll Thank you New Hampshire! #FITN #Trump2016 

Love making correct predictions. National Review is over. 

I will make our Military so big powerful & strong that no one will mess with us. #Trump2016 

I will be on Face The Nation this morning at various times across the U.S. CBSNews  Enjoy! Love making correct predictions. National Review is over.

I will be on ABC this morning at various times across the U.S. NBCNews  Enjoy!

Love making correct predictions. National Review is over.  

Word is that crying Glenn Beck left the GOP and doesn't have the right to vote in the Republican primary. Dumb as a rock.

Serious doubt in Illinois as to whether or not Cruz can run for President. First of many challenges. 

Just left a great event in Pella. Going to church tomorrow in Muscatine Iowa.

I will be on FOX with the great Judge Jeanine tonight at 9pm EST! Enjoy! #Trump2016

.@williebosshog such an honor to get your endorsement. You are a fantastic guy! It will not be forgotten. Don and Eric say hello!

Heading now to Pella Iowa. Big crowd! Remember Trump is a big buyer of Pella windows. See you soon!

For the great people of Iowa find your #IACaucus location at 

Just left Sioux Center Iowa. My speech was very well received. Truly great people! Packed house- overflow!

A wonderful story on Iowa voters by @arappeport of the @NYTimes.  

Failing Glenn Beck lost all credibility. Not only was he fired @ FOX he would have voted for Clinton over McCain. 

Based on Megyn Kelly's conflict of interest and bias she should not be allowed to be a moderator of the next debate.

Heading to Sioux County Iowa where the crowd is amazing. Dr. Robert Jeffress will make the introduction. Make America Great Again!

Ted Cruz poll numbers are down big. Because he was born in Canada and was until recently a Canadian citizen many believe he cannot run!

I am in Iowa watching all of these phony T.V. ads by the other candidates. All bull politicians are all talk and no action-it won't happen!

.@AnnCoulter has been amazing. We will win and establish strong borders we will build a WALL and Mexico will pay. We will be great again!

I will be the greatest job-producing president in American history. #Trump2016 #VoteTrump  

Dow down almost 2000 pts since start of year but still outperforming Wall Street's investment in Jeb. JEB wants Common Core

I am in Iowa. Will be making two speeches today. Good luck to all of the great folks on the East coast. Enjoy the beauty of the storm!

A wonderful article by a writer who truly gets it. I am for the people and the people are for me. #Trump2016  

Is Cruz honest? He is in bed w/ Wall St. & is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi low interest loans. No legal disclosure & never sold off assets.

Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for #POTUS. He could be Canadian Prime Minister.

Cruz says I supported TARP which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose. Puppet!

The only reason irrelevant @GlennBeck doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times. Very few listeners - sad!

One of the National Review lightweights came to my office begging for money like a dog. Why doesn't he say that?

Just watched Jeb's ad where he desperately needed mommy to help him. Jeb, Mom can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Ted Cruz went down big in just released Reuters poll - what's going on? Is it Goldman Sachs/Citi loans or Canada?

Rush Limbaugh is great tells it as he sees it---really honorable guy! Thanks Rush! #Trump2016

The tax scam Washington Post does among the most inaccurate stories of all. Really dishonest reporting.

Just received the new Fox poll. Thank you America! #Trump2016 

Wow! New National Zogby Poll just out:.TRUMP 45. CRUZ 13. RUBIO 8. Big numbers.

Leaving Nevada now for Iowa. Things are looking good - great new polls!

New Reuters poll! Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

The dying NRO National Review has totally given up the fight against Barrack Obama. They have been losing for years. I will beat Hillary!

Wow! This might be my highest numbers yet! Thank you to my opposition- you are totally ineffective & have been for years! 

I could've sworn I saw him outside Trump Tower the other day! 

@Lisa_Milicaj: Truth be told I  never heard of The National Review until they "tried" to declare war on you. No worries you got my vote!

After spending $89 million @JebBush is at the bottom of the barrel in polls. He is ashamed to use the name "Bush" in ads. Low energy guy!

The failing National Review Magazine has just been informed by the Republican National Committee that they cannot participate in debate

Ted Cruz complains about my views on eminent domain but without it we wouldn't have roads highways airports schools or even pipelines.

Make America Great Again! #Trump2016 

The late great William F. Buckley would be ashamed of what had happened to his prize the dying National Review!

Very few people read the National Review because it only knows how to criticize but not how to lead.

National Review is a failing publication that has lost it's way. It's circulation is way down w its influence being at an all time low. Sad!

Thank you Iowa! #FITN #IACaucus #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Why does Greta have a fired Bushy like dummy John Sununu on- spewing false info? I will beat Hillary by a lot she wants no part of Trump.

Happy birthday to my friend the great @jacknicklaus - a totally special guy!

New Day on CNN treats me very badly. @AlisynCamerota is a disaster. Not going to watch anymore.

Low energy candidate JebBush has wasted $80 million on his failed presidential campaign. Millions spent on me. He should go home and relax!

Sad sack JebBush has just done another ad on me with special interest money saying I won't beat Hillary - I WILL. But he can't beat me.

So sad that CNN and many others refused to show the massive crowd at the arena yesterday in Oklahoma. Dishonest reporting!

Wacko @glennbeck is a sad answer to the @SarahPalinUSA endorsement that Cruz so desperately wanted. Glenn is a failing crying lost soul!

Trump destroyed Hillary & Sanders moved in. But he didn't destroy her. Trump did. 

Palins brand among evangelicals is as gold as the faucets in Trump tower said Ralph Reed the chairman of the Faith & Freedom Coalition.

Wow the highly respected Governor of Iowa just stated that "Ted Cruz must be defeated." Big shoker! People do not like Ted.

A true honor to receive the endorsement of John Wayne's daughter....read: 

In the just released SC poll I increased my lead by 4 points since last poll by same firm. Up by 14! Cruz dropped 3. 

Thank you for your strong testimony when welcoming me to Liberty University yesterday- @JerryJrFalwell. 

Thank you Georgia! I appreciate all of your support. #Trump2016 

Just read your complete statement. You are an amazing guy & I really appreciate your words & support. I will see you soon!

On my way to Iowa- just received new national poll numbers. Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Really disgusting that the failing New York Times allows dishonest writers to totally fabricate stories.

Dope Frank Bruni said I called many people including Karl Rove losers-true! I never called my friend @HowardStern a loser- hes a winner!

Wow new polls just out have Trump up and Cruz down - he is a nervous wreck!

I don't think Ted Cruz can even run for President until he can assure Republican voters that being born in Canada is not a problem. Doubt!

Ted Cruz is falling in the polls. He is nervous. People are worried about his place of birth and his failure to report his loans from banks!

I loved being at Liberty University today! Record setting crowd unbelievable people! Thank you Jerry and Becki! 

We launched a new series of #Trump2016 videos via Facebook. A new topic everyday! Watch: 

A great morning with everyone @LibertyU! Thank you! Off to New Hampshire now. #Trump2016  

Leaving for Liberty University. I'll be speaking today in front of a record crowd. #Trump2016

Just a reminder that Ted Cruz supported liberal Justice John Roberts who gave us #Obamacare. 

Thank you @IvankaTrump for the kind words. I am very proud of the role model you are for so many. NH & IA radio ad: 

I am self-funding my campaign - putting up my own money not controlled.  Cruz is spending $millions on ads paid for by his N.Y. bosses.

Far more killed than anticipated in radical Islamic terror attack yesterday. Get tough and smart U.S. or we won't have a country anymore!

Big announcement in Ames Iowa on Tuesday! You will not want to miss this rally! #Trump2016 

Iran is going to buy 114 jetliners with a small part of the $150 billion we are giving them...but they won't buy from U.S. rather Airbus!

In Iran deal we get 4 prisoners. They get $150 billion 7 most wanted and many off watch list. This will create great incentive for others!

Interesting read from Peggy Noonan. 

Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about & demeaning? 

Wow! Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul & $1M low int. loan from Goldman Sachs. Hypocrite

Departing NH now- great morning with record crowd in Portsmouth- in a snow storm! Thank you! 

Greatly dishonest of Ted Cruz to file a financial disclosure form & not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St

When will Ted Cruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him.

Everybody that loves the people of New York and all they have been thru should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!

If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?

Ted is the ultimate hypocrite. Says one thing for money does another for votes.  

Great new numbers. Thank you!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Ted Cruz purposely and illegally did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!

Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?

Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.

The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there!

Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!

Ted Cruz said he ""didn't know"" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable

Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so

More radical Islam attacks today - it never ends! Strengthen the borders, we must be vigilant and smart. No more being politically correct.

Just got back from Iowa - had a great time with amazing people. Will be back soon!

Top searched candidate by state, as seen in the #GOPDebate media filing center. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Sen. Lindsey Graham embarrassed himself with his failed run for President and now further embarrasses himself with endorsement of Bush.

Jeb Bush, who did poorly last night in the debate and whose chances of winning are zero, just got Graham endorsement. Graham quit at O.

Do you think Iran would have acted so tough if they were Russian sailors? Our country was humiliated.

@Bonfiredesigns: Standing with @realDonaldTrump as he defends our sailors and military and Americans in the USA 

United States looks more and more like a paper tiger. Won't be that way if I win!

Iran humiliated the United States with the capture of our 10 sailors. Horrible pictures & images. We are weak. I will NOT forget!

Stuart Stevens is a dumb guy who fails @ virtually everything he touches. Romney campaign,his book,etc. Why does @andersoncooper put him on?

Why does @CNN & @andersoncooper waste airtime by putting failed campaign strategist, Stuart Stevens - who lost BIG for Romney - on the show?

Sadly, there is no way that Ted Cruz can continue running in the Republican Primary unless he can erase doubt on eligibility. Dems will sue!

Iran toys with U.S. days before we pay them, ridiculously, billions of dollars. Don't release money. We want our hostages back NOW!

Numerous polls have me beating Hillary Clinton. In a race with her, voter turnout will be the highest in U.S. history-I get most new voters!

The State Of The Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time. New leadership fast!

Just found out that @tedcruz is spending a fortune on Iowa push polls negative to me. Not nice, but OK! New polls are great.

The #SOTU speech is really boring, slow, lethargic - very hard to watch!

The Iran deal is terrible. Why didn't we get the uranium stockpile - it was sent to Russia. #SOTU

New CBS poll. #Trump2016 

Another new Iowa poll just released. Thank you! #IACaucus #FITN 

Such a serious problem for Ted & the GOP. Great doubt, Dems will sue! Let's all work together to solve this problem. 

On my way to Cedar Falls, Iowa, now. Will be great--I love the people of Iowa!

Fantastic job on @CNN  tonight. @kayleighmcenany is a winner! @donlemon

Megan Kelly recently said that she cant be wooed by Trump. She is so average in every way, who the hell wants to woo her!

So professional of ABC news to throw out the failing Union Leader newspaper from their debate. Paper won't survive, highly unethical!

Congratulations to my friend Sly Stallone on winning a GoldenG lobe. A wonderful guy- who has created something special, well deserved!

Why does Stephanopoulos allow a hater & racist like @tavissmiley to waste good airtime? ABC can do much better than him!

Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog. For starters, try getting a new publisher!

UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows. They aren't worthy of representing the great people NH.

This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed.

If their highly unethical behavior, including begging me for ads, isnt questionable enough, they have endorsed a candidate who cant win.

I am pleased to announce that I had the Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate. 

Remember, get TIME magazine! I am on the cover. Take it out in 4 years and read it again! Just watch...

Heading now for Reno, Nevada, for a big rally. Good poll numberd all over!

In the just out @FoxNews Poll, I easily beat Hillary Clinton - and I havn't even focused on her yet. On our way: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Yesterday in Iowa was amazing - two speeches in front of two great sold out crowds. They love that I am the only candidate self-funding!

@redletter99: Trump pummels his opponents - and the press | SunHerald @realDonaldTrump "

I want to thank the people of Iowa for an unbelievable day. The crowds were amazing. Will be back Tuesday!

Will be on Meet the Press with @ChuckTodd tomorrow morning. Enjoy!

I will be interviewed by Chris Wallace on Fox tomorrow morning. Tune in!

I'm protesting the @UnionLeader from having anything to do w/ ABC debate. Their unethical record doesn't give them the right to be involved!

David brilliantly tells it like it is -- the real deal! Read it!  

Time Magazine has me on the cover this week. David Von Drehle has written one of the best stories I have ever had.

Thank you so much. Earnest must have been a great person. 

Thank you. It is a true person of character that can change his opinion & do what is right. 

Constitutional law expert  #Laurence Tribe of Harvard says ""wrong to say it (natural born citizen) is a settled matter-it isn't settled).

South Carolina rally last night was so unbelievably exciting (and fun). I am now off to Iowa for two big rallies - packed houses. Love it!

Pat Buchanan gave a fantastic interview this morning on @CNN - way to go Pat, way ahead of your time!

Love seeing union & non-union members alike are defecting to Trump. I will create jobs like no one else. Their #Dem leaders cant compete!

I hope all workers demand that their @Teamsters reps endorse Donald J. Trump. Nobody knows jobs like I do! Dont let them sell you out!

On my way to South Carolina. Big Crowd--- look forward to it!

Not good news for Jeb Bush.

Not good news for Jeb Bush.

Not good news for Jeb Bush.

Not good news for Jeb Bush.

Not good news for Jeb Bush.  

Hank Greenberg, formerly of AIG, gave $10 million to the @JebBush campaign 3 months ago. He is not happy, a total waste of money!

Great time in Burlington, Vermont. Crowd was amazing.

We could only get a small fraction of this 25k crowd in. The movement to Make America Great Again is unbelievable! 

I'm leaving now for Burlington, Vermont. It will be wild!

Joy Behar, who was fired from her last show for lack of ratings, is even worse on @TheView. We love Barbara!

The The View ABC, once great when headed by Barbara Walters, is now in total freefall. Whoopi Goldberg is terrible. Very sad!

Hillary and her friends! 

Weak & ineffective JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. False advertising!

I have an idea for @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster. Try using your last name and don't be ashamed of it!

SenTedCruz Ted--free legal advice on how to pre-empt the Dems on citizen issue. Go to court now & seek Declaratory Judgment--you will win!

Massive crowd in VT tonight. Venue not big enough. Officials say NO to outside event and sound system. Arrive early!

Man shot inside Paris police station. Just announced that terror threat is at highest level. Germany is a total mess-big crime. GET SMART!

I will be in beautiful Burlington, Vermont, tonight for a rally. Will be great fun. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

It was a very wise move that Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship 18 months ago. Senator John McCain is certainly no friend of Ted!

Macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the S&P last year, plunging 46%. Very disloyal company. Another win for Trump! Boycott.

The failing UnionLeader newspaper in N.H. just sent The Trump Organization a letter asking that we take ads. How stupid, how desperate!

Do you believe that @UnionLeader in NH was demanding ads? Look at enclosed letter from them, just received: 

I will be on @wolfblitzer for a @CNNSitRoom interview today. Please join us 5PM ET.

Huge crowd expected tomorrow night! VT Police say first come, first serve. Arrive early!

Dont like SamuelLJacksons golf swing.  Not athletic. Ive won many club championships. Play him for charity!

I dont cheat at golf but @SamuelLJackson cheatswith his game he has no choiceand stop doing commercials!

HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my son, @EricTrump! Very proud of you! 

Germany is going through massive attacks to its people  by the migrants allowed to enter the country. New Years Eve was a disaster. THINK!

I dont know SamuelLJackson, to best of my knowledge haven't played golf w/him & think he does too many TV commercials boring. Not a fan.

Wow UnionLeader circulation in NH has dropped from 75,000 to around 10bad management. No wonder they begged me for ads.

The rally in Lowell, Massachusetts, was amazing. 10,000 people going wild. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Woody Johnson, owner of the NYJets, is @JebBushs finance chairman. If Woody wouldve been w/me, he wouldve been in the playoffs, at least!

I look forward to being in Lowell, Massachusetts, today. I hear a very big crowd is expected--we will have lots of fun!


By the way, Hillary & the MSM forgot to mention that Hillary is in the  Al-Shabaab terror video. 

The worst thing Hillary could do is have her husband campaign for her. Just watch.

Iran, with all of the money and all else given to them by Obama, has wanted a way to take over Saudi Arabia & their oil. THEY JUST FOUND IT!

Does anybody remember when Bill Clinton, in 2008, worked long and hard for Hillary? She LOST! Now Bill is at it again. Just watch.

Thank you for your support in Biloxi, MS! Let's ALL get out & VOTE in 2016, so we can #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 

Hillary said that guns don't keep you safe. If she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm!

Al-Shabbab, not ISIS, just made a video on me - they all will as front-runner & if I speak out against them, which I must. Hillary lied!

Just returned from Mississippi - a great evening.

Remember, I am self-funding my campaign, the only one in either party. I'm not controlled by lobbyists or special interests-only the U.S.A.!

When I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates, beware - the candidates are mere puppets $$$$!

I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women!

Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president. Jeb Bush is a low energy individual, but Hillary is not much better!

Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL, but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant!

Jeb Bush is a low energy ""stiff"" who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls. Has no chance!

Jeb Bush is a sad case. A total embarrassment to both himself and his family, he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads!

Jeb Bush is a sad case. A total embarrassment to both himself and his family, he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads!

Massive crowds expected in Mississippi tomorrow night. Look forward to it! 

The person that Hillary Clinton least wants to run against is, by far, me. It will be the largest voter turnout ever - she will be swamped!

I have never been interested in politics but because of you I want to get my political science degree. #trump2016""  Great!

I will be going to Mississippi tomorrow night - hear the crowds are going to be massive! Look forward to it.

Well, the year has officially begun. I have many stops planned and will be working very hard to win so that we can turn our country around!

Happy New Year from #MarALago! Thank you to my great family for all of their support. HAPPY NEW YEAR & THANK YOU! 

I will be on FoxNews live,  with members of my family, at 11:50 P.M. We will ring in the New Year together! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I would like to wish everyone A HAPPY AND HEALTHY NEW YEAR. WE MUST ALL WORK TOGETHER TO, FINALLY, MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN AND GREAT AGAIN!

Do you believe that The State Department, on NEW YEAR'S EVE, just released more of Hillary's e-mails. They just want it all to end. BAD!

THANK YOU ILLINOIS! Let's not forget to get family & friends- out to VOTE IN 20

HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my son @DonaldJTrumpJr! Very proud of you! #TBT 

I would feel sorry for @JebBush and how badly he is doing with his campaign other than for the fact he took millions of $'s of hit ads on me

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

People ask "why do you tweet and re-tweet to millions about Jeb Bush when he is so low in the polls?" Because of his big $ hit ads on me!

Jeb Bush has spent  $630000 and is at the bottom of the polls. I have spent almost nothing and am at the top. WIN! 

A GREAT day in South Carolina. Record crowd and fantastic enthusiasm. This is now a movement to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I predict that dying @UnionLeader newspaper which has been run into the ground by publisher "Stinky" Joe McQuaid will be dead in 2 years!

A lovely letter from the daughter of the late great John Wayne. Our country could use a John Wayne right now. 

Great poll- thank you Nevada! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

I'm going to be live with @ericbolling and @kimguilfoyle to ring in the New Year 2016. Everybody should tune in to @foxnews tomorrow night!

I never thought I'd be saying this but I've really enjoyed  RichLowry on television lately and he was terrific.

The dying UnionLeader newspaper in NH is in turmoil over my comments about them- like a bully that got knocked out!

THANK YOU Council Bluffs Iowa! The silent majority is silent no more! #Trump2016 #FITN 

Joe McQuaid of the dying Union Leader wanted ads lunches donations speeches from me and tweets---very unethical.

The great people of New Hampshire who I love are not properly served by the dying Union Leader newspaper.

Shows how dumb Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) of the dying Union Leader is to put out the letter I wrote saying why I didn't do his failed debate!

I hope he does better for Rubio than he did at the #Benghazi hearings which were a total disaster for Republicans & America!

We need a real President! 

Looking forward to being in Council Bluffs Iowa later today. Despite weather rally is on -- will be fantastic! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!

So I have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place. Jeb Bush has spent $59 million & done. Run country my way!

My campaign for president is $350000 under budget I have spent very little (and am in 1st place).Now I will spend big in Iowa/N.H./S.C.

Minorities line up behind.....Donald Trump" #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

I will be interviewed on the @TODAYshow at 7:00 A.M. Talking about the state of the race for president and more. Enjoy!

Remember that Bill Clinton was brought in to help Hillary against Obama in 2008. He was terrible failed badly and was called a racist!

Thank you to a #Trump2016 supporter for this video of my campaign- over the past 6 months. Video: 

Strange but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes while he will double & triple them a disaster!

Wages in are country are too low good jobs are too few  and people have lost faith in our leaders.We need smart and strong leadership now!

Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone shipped to other countries. We now are part time sad! I WILL FIX!

The middle-class has worked so hard are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no  effective raise in years. BAD

If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband with his terrible record of women abuse while playing the women's card on me she's wrong!

Hopefully the Republican National Committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in Virginia's Republican Party. FAST!

Straighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late. Stupid!  RNC

BernieSanders-who blew his campaign when he gave Hillary a pass on her e-mail crime said that I feel wages in America are too high. Lie!

What's going on in VA? What's the GOP doing?  They will lose the state because of the RNC!

Why are JebBush flunkies Anna Navarro and SE Cupp two of the dumbest people in politics always on the CNN panels.

The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. The Dems LOVE IT! Be smart and win for a change!

R.P.Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. Will now not allow desperately needed new voters. Suicidal mistake. RNC MUST ACT NOW!

It begins Republican Party of Virginia controlled by the RNC is working hard to disallow independent unaffiliated and new voters. BAD!

I will do far more for women than Hillary and I will keep our country safe something which she will not be able to do-no strength/stamina!

Thank you! #Trump2016 

Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM so inappropriate!

If the insurance companies are making lots of money and the # of uninsured is still largeObamacare is a failure since so expensive

A new terror warning was issued for European cties. At what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart. Weak leaders!

Criminal deportations in the U.S. are the lowest number in many years. We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country. MUST CHANGE!

The Phoenix V.A. it has just been reported is in worse shape than ever before. The wait is horrendous and people are dying. I will fix it

The same people that said I wouldn't run or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%) now say I won't beat Hillary.

He is so dishonest in his reporting. And to think he was going off the air until I came along-no ratings. I will beat Hillary!

CNN just announced that TRUMP was #1 story of 2015. Totally meaningless however if we don't WIN IT ALL and Make America Great Again!

When will the Democrats and Hillary in particular say "we must build a wall a great wall and Mexico is going to pay for it?" Never!

Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A. That will stop I will fix this quickly!

Remember when failed candidate @JebBush said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE? He's spent $59 million and is at 3%.

We have many problems in our house (country!) and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now because of me starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!

She gets what is going on in politics and sees it very clearly. Have her on more!

Merry Christmas to all. Have a great day and have a really amazing year. Together we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It will be done!

Great job on CNN today. Very wise indeed!

Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video. Bad reporting. Perhaps @NBC will do better next year-but doubt it!

True a total distortion of the facts!

Very dishonest in not showing the new @CNN Poll where I am at 39% 21points higher than Cruz. Be honest Chuck!

Why isn't Chuck Todd using the much newer CNN Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older poll?

Wow because of the pressure put on by me ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It's about time!

Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton a totally flawed candidate and beating her soundly

Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing New York Times are totally in the Hillary circle of bias. Think about Bill!

Wow even lowly Rand Paul has just past @JebBush in the new @CNN Poll. Jeb is at 3% I'm at 39%. Stop throwing your money down the drain!

In the ridiculous Jeb Bush ad about me Jeb is speaking to me during the debate but doesn't allow my answer which destroys him - SO SAD!

Poor Jeb Bush spent $50 million on his campaign I spent almost nothing. He's bottom (and gone) I'm top (by a lot). That's what U.S. needs!

Hillary said "I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign." I deplore the death and destruction she caused-stupidity

Merry Christmas & Happy Holidays! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Hillary when you complain about "a penchant for sexism who are you referring to. I have great respect for women. BE CAREFUL!

It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media.  New @CNN Poll amazing in ALL categories. 21 pt. Lead

Why does FoxNews give KarlRove so much airtime. He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased. Still thinks Romney won. Unfair coverage of Trump

FoxNews treats me so badly. Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out CNN Poll. All negative!

The @washingtonpost, which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on #Amazon, today did a nasty cartoon attacking @tedcruz kids. Bad

The silent majority- is silent no more! Remember the importance of VOTING! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

The Hillary Clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic. Be careful Hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card.

Thank you America! Together- we will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 

Big news just out - NEW CNN POLL  TRUMP  39 and leads in every major category. Likeability way up. CRUZ 18  CARSON 10  RUBIO 10

We need a PRESIDENT with strength, stamina, heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again!

It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. Sad!

When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama, it meant got beaten badly. The media knows this. Often used word in politics! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Wow, new Reuters Poll just out. Big lead if you want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  TRUMP 37  CRUZ 11 This is at the top of Drudge!

For those on TV defending my use of the word "schlonged bc #MSM is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. Dishonest #MSM

Once again, MSM is dishonest. "Schlonged is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got "schlonged" that meant beaten badly.

Jeb's big ad buy against me, paid for by lobbyists, shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements. He is really pathetic!

Watching CNN and consider SE Cupp to be one of the least talented people on television. Boring and biased!

The Donald should've been named Man of the Year. He dominates the polls, news, talk shows & social media. MAGA!

Henry McMaster Lt. Governor of South Carolina who endorsed me beat failed @CNN announcer Bakari Sellers so badly. Funny!

Jeff Zucker failed @NBC and he is now failing CNN.

CNN is unwatchable. Their news on me is fiction. They are a disgrace to the broadcasting industry and an arm of the Clinton campaign.

The documentary of me that CNN just aired is a total waste of time. I don't even know many of the people who spoke about me. A joke!

Final poll results from NBC on last nights Commander-in-Chief Forum. Thank you! #ImWithYou #MAGA 

It wasn't Matt Lauer that hurt Hillary last night. It was her very dumb answer about emails & the veteran who said she should be in jail.

#AmericaFirst #ImWithYou

With Luis Mexico and the United States would have made wonderful deals together - where both Mexico and the US would have benefitted.

Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is highly respected by President Pe√±a Nieto.

Hillary Clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past. She is totally confused. Unfit to serve as #POTUS.

Hillary just gave a disastrous news conference on the tarmac to make up for poor performance last night. She's being decimated by the media!

Last nights winner was clear & it will be proven time & time again - lets #MAGA!! Lets WIN!! #TrumpTrain

A rough night for Hillary Clinton.

Mainstream media never covered Hillarys massive hacking or coughing attack yet it is #1 trending. Whats up?

Message for undecided voters: Please wake up and vote DonaldTrump now! Trump/Pence very important save our America before too late!

Thank you! #AmericaFirst 

As a tribute to the late great Phyllis Schlafly I hope everybody can go out and get her latest book THE CONSERVATIVE CASE FOR TRUMP.

China wouldn't provide a red carpet stairway from Air Force One and then Philippines President calls Obama "the son of a whore." Terrible!

The truly great Phyllis Schlafly who honored me with her strong endorsement for president has passed away at 92. She was very special!

Thank you Ohio! #AmericaFirst

Can you believe that the Chinese would not give Obama the proper stairway to get off his plane - fight on tarmac! 

President Obama & Putin fail to reach deal on Syria - so what else is new? Obama is not a natural deal maker. Only makes bad deals!

We need to show Americans that Hillary will KILL our Country !! Vote for Trump !!

It defies belief the Web of Lies Hillary is spinning! One excuse after another. Then it's this then it's that.

Lyin' Hillary Clinton told the FBI that she did not know the "C" markings on documents stood for CLASSIFIED. How can this be happening?

To the African-American community: The Democrats have failed you for fifty years high crime poor schools no jobs. I will fix it VOTE "T

The polls are close so Crooked Hillary is getting out of bed and will campaign tomorrow.Why did she hammer 13 devices and acid-wash e-mails?

The Great State of Arizona where I just had a massive rally (amazing people) has a very weak and ineffective Senator Jeff Flake. Sad!

The Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders not weak people such as @JeffFlake if it is going to stop illegal immigration.

Doesn't fit the media narrative - so they wont share what I did for Jesse Jackson in 1999 - so I will!

CNN is so biased. Never ever watch them. Trump 2016!!

Crooked Hillary's V.P. pick said this morning that I was not aware that Russia took over Crimea. A total lie - and taken over during O term!

Wow the failing New York Times has not reported properly on Crooked's FBI release. They are at the back of the pack - no longer a credible source

CNN is so disgusting in their bias but they are having a hard time promoting Crooked Hillary in light of the new e-mail scandals.

Great visit to Detroit church fantastic reception and all @CNN talks about is a small protest outside. Inside a large and wonderful crowd!

I am returning to the Pensacola Bay Center in Florida- Friday 9/9/16 at 7pm. Join me!

Hillary Clinton didn't go to Louisiana and now she didn't go to Mexico. She doesn't have the drive or stamina to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Former President Vicente Fox who is railing against my visit to Mexico today also invited me when he apologized for using the "f bomb.

Now that African-Americans are seeing what a bad job Hillary type policy and management has done to the inner-cities they want TRUMP!

Crooked Hillary's brainpower is highly overrated.Probably why her decision making is so bad or as stated by Bernie S she has BAD JUDGEMENT

Does anyone know that Crooked Hillary who tried so hard was unable to pass the Bar Exams in Washington D.C. She was forced to go elsewhere

I know of NO ONE voting for Crooked Hillary! Her rallies are held in theatre & she still has room.

I will be making a major speech on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION on Wednesday in the GREAT State of Arizona. Big crowds looking for a larger venue.

I think that both candidates Crooked Hillary and myself should release detailed medical records. I have no problem in doing so! Hillary?

How quickly people forget that Crooked Hillary called African-American youth "SUPER PREDATORS" - Has she apologized?

I am very proud to have brought the subject of illegal immigration back into the discussion. Such a big problem for our country-I will solve

Wonderful Pastor Mark Burns was attacked viciously and unfairly on MSNBC by crazy morning mika on low ratings Morning Joe. Apologize!

What do African-Americans and Hispanics have to lose by going with me. Look at the poverty crime and educational statistics. I will fix it!

Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to solve the problems of poverty education and safety within the African-American & Hispanic communities.

CLINTON CORRUPTION AND HER SABOTAGE OF THE INNER CITIES.  Full speech transcript: 

Hillary Clinton only knows how to make a speech when it is a hit on me. No policy and always very short (stamina). Media gives her a pass!

HRC is using the oldest play in the Dem playbook- when their policies fail they are left w/this one tired argument! 

Hillary Clinton is using race-baiting to try to get African-American voters- but they know she is all talk and NO ACTION!

Hillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society. She should be ashamed of herself!

Just watched recap of #CrookedHillary's speech. Very short and lies. She is the only one fear-mongering!

So many in the African-American community are doing so badly poverty and crime way up employment and jobs way down: I will fix it promise

Just as we won the Cold War in part by exposing the evils of communism and the virtues of free markets.... Cont: 

This is my pledge to the American people: 

It's just a 2-point race Clinton 38% Trump 36%' 

Another health insurer is pulling back due to 'persistent financial losses on #Obamacare plans.' Only the beginning! 

#AmericasMerkel 

CLINTON REFUGEE PLAN COULD BRING IN 620000 REFUGEES IN FIRST TERM AT LIFETIME COST OF OVER $400 BILLION." 

#MakeAmericaSafeAgain  

Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad!

Stay on message" is the chant. I always do - trade jobs military vets 2nd A repeal Ocare borders etc - but media misrepresents!

I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!

It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!

I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!

My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.

If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say I would be beating Hillary by 20%

The failing New York Times which never spoke to me keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False I am who I am-never said

The failing New York Times talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary!

You are a man for the people because you know what it is like to be among the people #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #USA Loves U" Thanks

We're all enjoying you as well Mr. T.! You've inspired Hope and a Positive Spirit throughout America! God bless you!" Nice

Yes you are my hero I admire you for laying down your glorious luxurious life to get beat up for America!!!

We now have confirmation as to one reason Crooked H wanted to be sure that nobody saw her e-mails - PAY-FOR-PLAY. How can she run for Pres.

PAY-FOR-PLAY

PAY-FOR-PLAY

PAY-FOR-PLAY

Thank you for all that you are doing for us! You campaign endlessly and have spent millions.We love you! #TrumpTrain" Thanks

I am truly enjoying myself while running for president. The people of our country are amazing - great numbers on November 8th!

The failing New York Times has become a newspaper of fiction. Their stories about me always quote non-existent unnamed sources. Very dishonest!

Will be on Sean Hannity tonight at 10pm hosted by @GovMikeHuckabee. Enjoy!

Thank you Erie Pennsylvania! Together we will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 

Unbelievable support in Florida last night - thank you! #MAGA 

ISIS gained tremendous strength during Hillary Clinton's term as Secretary of State. When will the dishonest media report the facts!

I love watching these poor pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out. They can't!

They can't! They can't!

They can't!

They can't!

A massive tax increase will be necessary to fund Crooked Hillary Clinton's agenda. What a terrible (and boring) rollout that was yesterday!

hank you for coming to Pennsylvania today.

Ratings challenged CNN reports so seriously that I call President Obama (and Clinton) "the founder" of ISIS & MVP. THEY DON'T GET SARCASM?

The founder of ISIS!

The founder of ISIS!

Great job today by the NYPD in protecting the people and saving the climber.

Morning Joe's weakness is its low ratings. I don't watch anymore but I heard he went wild against Rudy Giuliani and #2A - sad & irrelevant!

You were fantastic in defending both the Second Amendment and me last night on CNN. Don Lemon is a lightweight - dumb as a rock

Dumb as a rock.

Dumb as a rock.

Dumb as a rock.

Dumb as a rock.

Now cut off my mic! Bongino refuses to be bullied by Don Lemon over Trump 2nd Amendment  HEATED! 

Media desperate to distract from Clinton's anti-2A stance. I said pro-2A citizens must organize and get out vote to save our Constitution!

When is the media going to talk about Hillary's policies that have gotten people killed like Libya open borders and maybe her emails?

We Can Do Better We Must Do Better We Will Do Better  By LTG (R) Keith Kellogg and LTG (R) Michael Flynn @GenFlynn http

As Senator Clinton promised 200000 jobs in Upstate New York - her efforts fell flat.' 

Many people are saying that the Iranians killed the scientist who helped the U.S. because of Hillary Clinton's hacked emails.

#ICYMI: "Will Media Apologize to Trump?" 

Michael Morell the lightweight former Acting Director of C.I.A. and a man who has made serious bad calls is a total Clinton flunky!

The media is going crazy. They totally distort so many things on purpose. Crimea nuclear "the baby" and so much more. Very dishonest!

'Donald Trump Is the middle-class growth candidate' 

I am not just running against Crooked Hillary Clinton I am running against the very dishonest and totally biased media - but I will win!

#CrookedHillary is not fit to be our next president! #TrumpPence16  

Heading to New Hampshire - will be talking about Hillary saying her brain SHORT CIRCUITED and other things!

Anybody whose mind "SHORT CIRCUITS" is not fit to be our president! Look up the word "BRAINWASHED.

Crooked Hillary said loudly and for the world to see that she "SHORT CIRCUITED" when answering a question on her e-mails. Very dangerous!

Hillary Clinton is being badly criticized for her poor performance in answering questions. Let us all see what happens!

Good luck #TeamUSA #OpeningCeremony #Rio2016

DRUDGE_REPORT: FORMER HOSTAGE SAYS PLANE WAITED UNTIL MONEY ARRIVED. 

DRUDGE_REPORT: 'Win-lose deal that benefits Iran and hurts United States'. 

Hillary Clinton has bad judgment and is unfit to serve as President. 

The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva Switzerland not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!

President Obama refuses to answer question about Iran terror funding.  I won't dodge questions as your President. 

Obama's disastrous judgment gave us ISIS rise of Iran and the worst economic numbers since the Great Depression!

President Obama should ask the DNC about how they rigged the election against Bernie.

See you tomorrow w/ Gov. Mike Pence Iowa & Wisconsin!  3pm-

Great afternoon in Ohio & a great evening in Pennsylvania - departing now. See you tomorrow Virginia! 

Just leaving Mechanicsburg PA. Incredible crowd-- so enthusiastic! Will be back soon. #MAGA 

Vast numbers of manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania have moved to Mexico and other countries. That will end when I win!

Thanks to @pnehlen for your kind words very much appreciated.

Join me in Florida on Wednesday! Daytona & Jacksonville.

During the GOP convention CNN cut away from the victims of illegal immigrant violence. They dont want them heard. 

When will CNN do a segment on Hillarys plan to increase Syrian refugees 550% and how much it will cost?

Hillary Clinton raked in money from regimes that horribly oppress women and gays & refuses to speak out against Radical Islam.

Hillary whose decisions have led to the deaths of many accepted $ from a business linked to ISIS. Silence at CNN. 

Crooked Hillary Clinton is 100% owned by her donors. #ImWithYou #MAGA 

Thank you Columbus Ohio! I will be back soon. #ImWithYou #MAGA 

Thank you Oklahoma & Virginia!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #ImWithYou 

People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillary....that's really saying something!

The people who support Hillary sit behind CNN anchor chairs or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life.

Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary?

When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary's pay-for-play at State Department?

CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime failing schools and vanishing jobs.

CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton.

Join Governor Mike Pence in Reno Nevada- tonight at 7pm! Tickets available at: 

#CrookedHillary  

So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine they have already taken Crimea and continue to push. That's what I said!

When I said in an interview that Putin is "not going into Ukraine you can mark it down I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea!

This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!

Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice!

Wow, it is unbelievable how distorted, one-sided and biased the media is against us. The failing New York Times is a joke. CNN is laughable!

Without absolutely OWNING the liberal media, HillaryClinton wouldn't stand a chance. #VoterFraud and mainstream media her only hope.

The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H?

I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!

Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our ""leaders"" to eradicate it!

Nielson Media Research final numbers on ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: TRUMP  32.2 MILLION.  CLINTON 27.8 MILLION.  Thank you!

Thank you to all of the television viewers that made my speech at the Republican National Convention #1 over Crooked Hillary and DEMS.

Can you imagine if I had the small crowds that Hillary is drawing today in Pennsylvania. It would be a major media event! CNN FoxNews

NATO commander agrees members should pay up!

NATO commander agrees members should pay up!

NATO commander agrees members should pay up!

Wow, NATO's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must PAY THEIR BILLS. This is a general I will like!

The ""Rust Belt"" was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico. END!

Crooked's stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 - with Bill, VP

#CrookedHillary = Obama's third term, which would be terrible news for our economic growth - seen below. 

Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?

I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!

Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two ""Big Thursdays"" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings

#CrookedHillary 

Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster!

Violent crime is rising across the United States, yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities.

Just got back from Colorado. The love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible. Big crowds!

While I am in OH & PA - you can also join Mike Pence in Nevada on Mon!  
 
American homeownership rate in Q2 2016 was 62.9% - lowest rate in 51yrs. WE will bring back the  'American Dream!' 

'American Dream!'

We are suffering through the worst long-term unemployment in the last 70 years. I want change - Crooked Hillary Clinton does not.

Hillary can never win over Bernie supporters. Her foreign wars,  NAFTA/TPP support & Wall Street ties are driving away millions of votes.

Colorado was amazing yesterday! So much support. Our tax, trade and energy reforms will bring great jobs to Colorado and the whole country.

ONLY TRUMP CAN UNITE AMERICA AND FIX OBAMA'S MISTAKES!!!

Thank you Denver, Colorado!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 

As usual, Hillary & the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games. Same as last time w/ Bernie. Unacceptable!

#CrookedHillary Job Application 

Hillary Clinton should not be given national security briefings in that she is a lose cannon with extraordinarily bad judgement & insticts.

Thank you to the amazing law enforcement officers in Colorado! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #LESM 

Only a Reagan or a Trump-like figure in the White House will achieve this goal."" 

Even Bill is tired of the lies, SAD! 
 
What Bernie Sanders really thinks of Crooked Hillary Clinton. 

I am watching Crooked Hillary speak. Same old stuff, our country needs change!

Wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary. She sold them out, V.P. pick!

In Hillary Clinton's America - things get worse. #TrumpPence16 

The dishonest media didn't mention that Bernie Sanders was very angry looking during Crooked's speech. He wishes he didn't make that deal!

Crooked Hillary said that I ""couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign."" Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her!

If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York, he wouldn't get 10% of the vote - they would run him out of town!  #NeverHillary

Little"" Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster!

General John Allen, who I never met but spoke against me last night, failed badly in his fight against ISIS. His record = BAD  #NeverHillary

Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech. Many of her statements were lies and fabrications!

Mike Pence!!

Mike Pence!!

Mike Pence!!

Ann Coulter is very smart!

Ann Coulter is very smart!

Ann Coulter is very smart!

Two policemen just shot in San Diego, one dead. It is only getting worse. People want LAW AND ORDER!

Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and ""forgot"" to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream!

The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. CNN and the little watched Morning Joe = SAD!

SAD!

SAD!

SAD!

SAD!

SAD!

SAD!

SAD!

No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.

Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world.

Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety.

Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street!

Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.

Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.

Departing now - thank you Cedar Rapids, Iowa. This is a MOVEMENT! 

#CrookedHillary 

Dems warn not to underestimate Trump's potential win"" 

Great to be back in Iowa! TBT with Jerry Jr Falwell joining me in Davenport- this past winter. #MAGA 

Median household income is down for the middle class since Obama took office. It will only go further down under Clinton.

A vote for Clinton-Kaine is a vote for TPP, NAFTA, high taxes, radical regulation, and massive influx of refugees.

AMERICA'S FUTURE 

Bernie caved! 

Donald Trump Sees 17-Point Positive Swing in Two Weeks

Trump makes a funny, obvious joke about Russia going after Hillary's emails & U.S. media goes insane with fury.

Obama Refers to Himself 119 Times During Hillary Nominating Speech... 

President Obama spoke last night about a world that doesnt exist. 70% of the people think our country is going in the wrong direction. #DNC

My message is resonating with the PEOPLE

Barack is offended that I will demand that #NATO allies pay their fair share. #DemsInPhilly

Barack is offended that I will demand that #NATO allies pay their fair share. #DemsInPhilly

Our country does not feel 'great already' to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty, violence and despair.

Shooting deaths of police officers up 78% this year. We must restore law and order and protect our great law enforcement officers!

#CrookedHillary 

Thank you to our amazing law enforcement officers! #MAGA 

Trump right: Illegal families crossing border set to double, 51,152 so far"" 

Great new poll - thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton's 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI!

Join our next Vice President, Mike Pence in Wisconsin tonight & Michigan Thursday! 

Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic

Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to ""carpet bomb"" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz!

Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!

Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!

The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!

Funny how the failing New York Times is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said ""Trump is a genius."" America 1st!

As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.

Just like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP.  

Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep?

I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!

No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated!

You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is, and neither does ISIS (a good thing). Please get your facts straight - thanks. 

For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia.

In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy!

Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here.

Bernie's exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed!

The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!

Thank you New Hampshire!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Pocahontas bombed last night! Sad to watch.

Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great

Funny, if you listen to Fox News, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference

Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.

Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!

Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.

If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.

I was at Fox News and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!

Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke!

While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.

Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War.

Thank you OHIO! #TrumpPence16 

Thank you Roanoke, Virginia- be back soon! #TrumpPence16

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain  

Great POLL numbers are coming out all over. People don't want another four years of Obama, and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGA

The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!

Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!

Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!

Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her ""servant"" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie.

If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.

Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!

How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!

The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me

Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing!

The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!

The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!

The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!

Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!

Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out

If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild

The CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!

I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!

Today proves what I have always known, that Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz

Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!

There is no longer a Bernie Sanders ""political revolution."" He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!

An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.

Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!

Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!

Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT

The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!

Kaine supported the stupidest deal in the history of deals 

Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart!

The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud!

Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!

I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!

Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!

Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!

Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.

Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED

Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!

Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!

The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?

General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS! #MakeAmericaSafeAgain

I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.

Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?

Another attack, this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich.

One of the best produced, including the incredible stage & set, in the history of conventions. Great unity! Big T.V. ratings!

Thank you Cleveland. We love you and will be back many times!

What a great four days in Cleveland. So proud of the great job done by the RNC and all. The police and Secret Service were fantastic!

MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN! #RNCinCLE 

FORMAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE NOMINATION! #TrumpPence16

This is a MOVEMENT! #RNCinCLE 

Thank you Donald J Trump Jr. Proud of you! 

Great job Ivanka Trump! #RNCinCLE 

Other than a small group of people who have suffered massive and embarrassing losses, the party is VERY united. Great love in the arena!

Ted Cruz talks about the Constitution but doesn't say that if the Dems win the Presidency, the new JUSTICES appointed will destroy us all!

I am soooo proud of my children, Don, Eric and Tiffany - their speeches, under enormous pressure, were incredible. Ivanka intros me tonight!

Great job Eric Trump! Proud of you! #AmericaFirst #RNCinCLE 

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Arena was packed, totally electric!

Mike Pence was fantastic tonight. Will be a great V.P.

Our next Vice President of the United States of America, Gov. Mike Pence!

Wow, Ted Cruz got booed off the stage, didn't honor the pledge! I saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway. No big deal!

Great job Eric Trump! Proud of you!  #AmericaFirst #RNCinCLE 

Thank you Scott Walker! #AmericaFirst  #RNCinCLE 

Thank you to Governor Scott Walker for such warm support. Great speech!

Thank you Ingraham!

Watching the #GOPConvention #AmericaFirst #RNCinCLE

John Kasich was never asked by me to be V.P. Just arrived in Cleveland - will be a great two days!

The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails.

Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!

In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs!

Bill Hemmer of FoxNews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. More than in past years.

Congratulations to my children, Don and Tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night. I am very proud of you!

Such a great honor to be the Republican Nominee for President of the United States. I will work hard and never let you down! AMERICA FIRST!

The ROLL CALL is beginning at the Republican National Convention. Very exciting!

Democrats are coming to TRUMP. I used to be proud of the dem party. No more It is crooked and not for the people.

It was truly an honor to introduce my wife, Melania. Her speech and demeanor were absolutely incredible. Very proud! #GOPConvention

Will be on Oreilly Factor tonight at 8:30pm @FoxNews- prior to Melania's speech at the #GOPConvention. Tune in- she will do great!  

Networks other than low ratings @CNN have been very fair and exciting!

CNN is the worst.T hey go to their dumb, one-sided panels when a podium speaker is for Trump! VAST MAJORITY want: Make America Great Again!

Looking forward to being at the convention tonight to watch all of the wonderful speakers including my wife Melania. Place looks beautiful!

President Obama just had a news conference but he doesn't have a clue. Our country is a divided crime scene and it will only get worse!

Our country is totally divided and our enemies are watching. We are not looking good we are not looking smart we are not looking tough!

Bad times for divided USA!

Bad times for divided USA!

Bad times for divided USA!

Bad times for divided USA!

We are TRYING to fight ISIS and now our own people are killing our police. Our country is divided and out of control. The world is watching

We grieve for the officers killed in Baton Rouge today. How many law enforcement and people have to... 

The ratings at Fox News blow away the ratings of CNN - not even close. That's because CNN is the Clinton News Network and people don't like

Fox News is much better and far more truthful than CNN which is all negative. Guests are stacked for Crooked Hillary! I don't watch.

If Goofy Elizabeth Warren a very weak Senator didn't lie about her heritage (being Native American) she would be nothing today. Pick her H

I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas as her V.P. Then we can litigate her fraud!

It doesn't matter that Crooked Hillary has experience look at all of the bad decisions she has made. Bernie said she has bad judgement!

As the days and weeks go by  we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in - Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions!

We are going to have a great time in Cleveland. Will lead to special results for our country. We will Make America Great Again!

Goofy Elizabeth Warren who may be the least productive Senator in the U.S. Senate must prove she is not a fraud. Without the con it's over

Thank you to Jack Morgan Tamara Neo Cheryl Ann Kraft and all of my friends and supporters in Virginia. GREAT JOB!

Great news! We've been nominated for Ireland's Best Golf Hotel 2016. We would appreciate your vote! 

Thank you to Chris Cox and Bikers for Trump - Your support has been amazing. I will never forget. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Thank you! #TrumpPence16 

Crooked Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for by Wall Street lobbyists and special interests. She will sell our country down the tubes!

Very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes Crooked Hillary Clinton can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money!

Crooked Hillary who embarrassed herself and the country with her e-mail lies has been a DISASTER on foreign policy. Look what's happening!

Crooked Hillary is spending big Wall Street money on ads saying I don't have foreign policy experience yet look what her policies have done

Look forward to introducing Governor Mike Pence (who has done a spectacular job in the great State of Indiana). My first choice from start!

Look forward to Governor Mike Pence V.P. introduction tomorrow in New York City.

I am pleased to announce that I have chosen Governor Mike Pence as my Vice Presidential running mate. News conference tomorrow at 11:00 A.M.

Four more years of weakness with a Crooked Hillary Administration is not acceptable. Look what has happened to the world with O & Hillary!

#NeverTrump is never more. They were crushed last night in Cleveland at Rules Committee by a vote of 87-12. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

My prayers and condolences to the victims and families of the terrible tragedy in Nice France. We are with you in every way!

In light of the horrible attack in Nice France I have postponed tomorrow's news conference concerning my Vice Presidential announcement.

Another horrific attack this time in Nice France. Many dead and injured. When will we learn? It is only getting worse.

I employ many people in the State of Virginia - JOBS JOBS JOBS! Crooked Hillary will sell us out just like her husband did with NAFTA.

Another new poll. Thank you for your support! Join the MOVEMENT today!  #ImWithYou 

Great new poll- thank you America! #Trump2016 #ImWithYou 

I will be making the announcement of my Vice Presidential pick on Friday at 11am in Manhattan. Details to follow.

If I win the Presidency we will swamp Justice Ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions!

Even the NYTimes and Washington Post Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach. What was she thinking?

Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge!

On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party. I am spending a lot myself and also helping others.

Voters understand that Crooked Hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity.

Despite spending $500k a day on TV ads alone #CrookedHillary falls flat in nationwide Quinnipiac Poll. Having ZERO impact. Sad!!

Despite spending $500k a day on TV ads alone #CrookedHillary falls flat in nationwide Quinnipiac Poll. Having ZERO impact. Sad!!

Sad!!

Sad!!

Lyin' Crooked Hillary's email stories all have one thing in common. 

Is President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves? Think about it and let me know!

The Republican platform is most  pro-Israel of all time!

New GOP platform now includes language that supports the border wall. We will build the wall and MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!

#CrookedHillary is outspending me by a combined 31 to 1 in Florida Ohio & Pennsylvania. I haven't started yet! 

Thank you Florida Ohio and Pennsylvania! #CrookedHillary is not qualified. 

Justice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot - resign! 

The American people agree. No free pass for #CrookedHillary! 

To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals & global special interests we welcome you with open arms. People first.

Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton.

Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.

#CrookedHillary is not qualified! 

I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. They are not happy that he is selling out!

Bernie Sanders who has lost most of his leverage has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry!

This election is a choice between law order & safety - or chaos crime & violence. I will make America safe again for everyone. #ImWithYou

For too many years our inner cities have been left behind. I am going to deliver jobs safety and protection for those in need.

Crime is out of control and rapidly getting worse. Look what is going on in Chicago and our inner cities. Not good!

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #ImWithYou 

Senior United States District Judge Robert E. Payne today ruled in favor of Trump campaign delegates who had argued..

Speech on Veterans' Reform: 

Great poll- Florida! Thank you! 

Thoughts and prayers with the victims and their families- along with everyone at the Berrien County Courthouse in St. Joseph Michigan.

Join me in Westfield Indiana- tomorrow night at 7:30pm! #Trump2016  Tickets: 

I heard that the underachieving John King of CNN on Inside Politics was one hour of lies. Happily few people are watching - dead network!

The media is so dishonest. If I make a statement they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish.They think the public is stupid!

President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. He is living in a world of the make believe!

Look what is happening to our country under the WEAK leadership of Obama and people like Crooked Hillary Clinton. We are a divided nation!

New poll - thank you! #Trump2016 

Way to go Serena Williams  - you are a true champion. Proud of you!

MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN! 

Isn't it sad that on a day of national tragedy Hillary Clinton is answering softball questions about her email lies on CNN?

Due to the horrific events taking place in our country I have decided to postpone my speech on economic opportunity- today in Miami.

Last night's horrific execution-style shootings of 12 Dallas law enforcement officers...

Prayers and condolences to all of the families who are so thoroughly devastated by the horrors we are all watching take place in our country

After today Crooked Hillary can officially be called Lyin' Crooked Hillary.

Just leaving D.C. Had great meetings with Republicans in the House and Senate. Very interesting day! These are people who love our country!

Great being in Cincinnati Ohio last night- thank you! Off to Washington D.C. now. #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst 

Where is the outrage for this Disney book? Is this the 'Star of David' also?  Dishonest media! #Frozen 

To all of my twitter followers please contribute whatever you can to the campaign. We must beat Crooked Hillary. 

Convention speaker schedule to be released tomorrow. Let today be devoted to Crooked Hillary and the rigged system under which we live.

I have over seven million hits on social media re Crooked Hillary Clinton. Check it out Sleepy Eyes 

Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd a man with so little touch for politics is at it again. He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C.

Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd a man with so little touch for politics is at it again. He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C.

Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City.

Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center Airport - and destroyed City

I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes now many bankruptcies.

Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch her time will come!

The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges but...

Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest incompetent and of very bad judgement.

Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive highly classified information." Not fit!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT!

I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with "murder." Come November 8 she's out!

Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win

FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem

The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual bad judgment.

It was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday. She has done a fantastic job for the people of Iowa and U.S. Will see her again!

Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace!

Meet the Trumps! Hope you enjoy!

Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?

Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?

With Hillary and Obama the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is "guilty as hell" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33000 missing e-mails?

The only people who are not interested in being the V.P. pick are the people who have not been asked!

I look forward to meeting Joni Ernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!

I look forward to meeting Joni Ernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!

I look forward to meeting Joni Ernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!

Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday. Very impressed great people!

Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday. Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd the end result was solid!

Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff's Star or plain star!

Happy 4th of July! #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst 

Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change!

The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this!

In Bangladesh hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed!

I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!

The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting "go away no pictures.

Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about "grandkids" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?

THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!

THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!

THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!

On Saturday a great man Elie Wiesel passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!

Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged & corrupt!

Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.

Just watched meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd and the entire show is against me.The good news-the people get it!

It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said the system is totally rigged!

It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!


Reminder: last year Clinton pledged she had turned over all work-related email under penalty of perjury  

Thank you! #AmericaFirst 

If I become the next POTUS- they will not be ignoring!  

If I become the next POTUS- they will not be ignoring!  

Crooked Hillary -- Makes History!

The #2A to our Constitution is clear. The right of the people to keep & bear Arms shall not be infringed upon. 

#AmericaFirst #ImWithYou 

The speakers slots at the Republican Convention are totally filled with a long waiting list of those that want to speak - Wednesday release

Just read in the failing New York Times that I was not aware "the event had to be held in Cleveland" - a total lie. These people are sick!

When you can't say it - or see it -- you can't fix it. We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN! #ImWithYou #AmericaFirst 

These crimes won't be happening if I'm elected POTUS. Killer should have never been here. #AmericaFirst  

Yet another terrorist attack today in Israel -- a father shot at by a Palestinian terrorist was killed while: 

Horrible killing of a 13 year old American girl at her home in Israel by a Palestinian terrorist. We must get tough. 

Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton. The system is totally rigged. Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?

Bill Clinton's meeting was a total secret. Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter.

As Bernie Sanders said Hillary Clinton has bad judgement. Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary!

The reason I put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. $50 million loan. I have totally terminated the loan!

The very dishonest NBC News refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign. Done deal!

One of the reasons Hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldn't see how she got rich- selling out America.  

Why would college graduates want Crooked Hillary as their President? She will destroy them!  

The story with Hillary will never change. 

For reasons only they can explain the US Chamber wants to continue our bad trade deals rather than renegotiating and making them better.

Tremendous day in Massachusetts and Maine. Thank you to everyone for making it so special!

As of April this year Hillary had spent $2640000 on her campaign Mr.Trump $550000. Self Funding

ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will. Not capable!

ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will. Not capable!

ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will. Not capable!

Why would the USChamber be upset by the fact that I want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that I want penalties for cheaters?

The US CHAMBER must fight harder for the American worker. China and many others are taking advantage of U.S. with our terrible trade pacts

Iron Mike Tyson was not asked to speak at the Convention though I'm sure he would do a good job if he was. The media makes everything up!

This administration is incapable of keeping our country safe!

We must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the United States.

Yet another terrorist attack this time in Turkey. Will the world ever realize what is going on? So sad.

Hillary Clintons Presidency would be catastrophic for the future of our country. She is ill-fit with bad judgment.

Benghazi is just another Hillary Clinton failure. It just never seems to work the way it's supposed to with Clinton.

Check it out - 2nd video on Lying Crooked Hillary is now online! Watch it here:  

Cancel cable - sick of their bad coverage of you and the fawning over Clinton. Listened to your great speech on YouTube


Cancel cable - sick of their bad coverage of you and the fawning over Clinton. Listened to your great speech on YouTube

Ann Coulter also can't help but notice the stock market's reaction as I was speaking. #UPUPUP

Create jobs!

Maybe If corporations weren't overtaxed they would stay.

CNN is all negative when it comes to me. I don't watch it anymore.

The media is unrelenting. They will only go with and report a story in a negative light. I called Brexit (Hillary was wrong) watch November

Crooked Hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the U.S. Senate goofy Elizabeth Warren who lied on heritage.

Under a Trump presidency America will make brilliant new trade deals!

Hillary read "sigh" off the Teleprompter She's so fake she has to be told how to feel!

W know they're fake just like poles during primary. I'm sure I will crush #CrookedHillary in general

The "dirty" poll done by ABC is a disgrace. Even they admit that many more Democrats were polled. Other polls were good.

Crooked Hillary Attacks Foreign Government Donations - While Ignoring Her Own: 

Crooked Hillary Clinton got Brexit wrong. I said LEAVE will win. She has no sense of markets and such bad judgement. Only a question of time

Hillary Clinton is not a change agent just the same old status quo! She is spending a fortune I am spending very little. Close in polls!

People in our country want borders and without them the old line pols like Crooked Hillary will not win. It is time for CHANGE -- and JOBS!

Top 50 Facts About Crooked Hillary Clinton From Trump 'Stakes Of The Election' Address: 

The ABC poll sample is heavy on Democrats.  Very dishonest - why would they do that? Other polls good!

Crooked Hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at Turnberry. Shows me hitting shot but I never did = lie! Was there to support son

Clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on BREXIT with big dollar ads. Disgraceful!

Crooked Hillary Clinton who called BREXIT 100% wrong (along with Obama) is now spending Wall Street money on an ad on my correct call.

George Will one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago) has left the Republican Party.He's made many bad calls

Just landed in New York - a one night stay in Scotland. Turnberry came out magnificently. My son Eric did a great job - under budget!

Obama has blocked ICE officers and BP from doing their jobs. That ends when I am President!

I have never liked the media term 'mass deportation' -- but we must enforce the laws of the land!

We only want to admit those who love our people and support our values. #AmericaFirst

We must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place.

So funny Crooked Hillary called BREXIT so incorrectly and now she says that she is the one to deal with the U.K. All talk no action!

Thoughts and prayers are with everyone in West Virginia- dealing with the devastating floods. #ImWithYou

And we will get it back once we have President Trump! Can't wait!

What has happened in the UK in the last 12 hours is exactly what will happen in November..vote TRUMP 2016

Many people are equating BREXIT and what is going on in Great Britain with what is happening in the U.S. People want their country back!

The opening of Trump Turnberry in Scotland was a big success. Good timing I was here for BREXIT. Very exciting news conference today!

Crooked Hillary called it totally wrong on BREXIT - she went with Obama - and now she is saying we need her to lead. She would be a disaster

I want all Americans to succeed together. President Obama's illegal executive amnesty undermines job prospects for...

New Government data by the Center for Immigration Studies shows more than 3M new legal & illegal immigrants settled..

America is proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder w/a free & ind UK. We stand together as friends as allies & as a people w/a shared history.

Self-determination is the sacred right of all free people's and the people of the UK have exercised that right for all the world to see.

Getting ready to open the magnificent Turnberry in Scotland. What a great day especially when added to the brave & brilliant vote.

Statement Regarding British Referendum on E.U. Membership 

Just arrived in Scotland. Place is going wild over the vote. They took their country back just like we will take America back. No games!

Congratulations to my son Eric on the fantastic job he has done in rebuilding Turnberry and its great Ailsa Course. Always support kids!

Leaving now for a one night trip to Scotland in order to be at the Grand Opening of my great Turnberry Resort. Will be back on Sat. night!

Meet the amazing mother whose letter I read during my speech. She lost her son to policies supported by Clinton. 

Read my full statement here on the Supreme Court's executive amnesty decision #imwithyou  

Here is another CNN lie. The Clinton News Network is losing all credibility. Im not watching it much anymore.  

CNN which is totally biased in favor of Clinton should apologize. They knew they were wrong.  

Trump's speech today is the best persuasion I have ever seen. Game over. 

Our inner cities have been left behind. We will never have the resources to support our people if we have an open border.

On immigration Im consulting with our immigration officers & our wage-earners. Hillary Clinton is consulting with Wall Street.

Obama & Clinton should stop meeting with special interests & start meeting with the victims of illegal immigration.

Hillary Clintons open borders are tearing American families apart. I am going to make our country Safe Again for all Americans. #Imwithyou

SC has kept us safe from exec amnesty--for now. But Hillary has pledged to expand it taking jobs from Hispanic & African-American workers.

I was so impressed by my speech yesterday. He was the best I've ever seen him." 

Hillary Lies to Benghazi Families #CrookedHillary  

ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama."  --  Donald J. Trump

Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency."  --   Donald J. Trump

Thank you to Donald Rumsfeld for the endorsement. Very much appreciated. Clinton's conduct has been "disqualifying.

You have great children future presidents...and we all see were raised right and out there for their father." Thank you.

Hillary says things can't change. I say they have to change. It's a choice between Americanism and her corrupt globalism. #Imwithyou

Crooked Hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief! She will be a disaster for jobs and the economy!

I will be interviewed by Lou Dobbs

Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State. She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich! Corrupt dangerous dishonest.

If you want to know about Hillary Clinton's honesty & judgment ask the family of Ambassador Stevens.

Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays.

I am "the king of debt."That has been great for me as a businessman but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt will fix U.S.

Obama-Clinton inherited $10T in debt and turned it into nearly $20T.  They have bankrupted 

Hillary Clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans - and make everyone less safe.

How can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk?

Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as Secretary of State costing Americans millions of jobs.

Hillary says this election is about judgment.  She's right.  Her judgement has killed thousands unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy.

I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton.

Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our president-really bad judgement and a temperament according to new book which is a mess!

When I said that if within the Orlando club you had some people with guns I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees

We are so proud of you Dustin. Your reaction under pressure was amazing. First of many Majors. You are a true CHAMPION!

Yesterday's failing NYTimes fraudulently shows an empty room prior to my speech when in fact it was packed! 

How can the NY Times show an empty room hours before my speech even started when they knew it was going to be packed? So totally dishonest!

My Speech Is a Game Changer.

Thank you Dallas PD!

Thank you Atlanta Georgia! Will be back soon! #AmericaFirst 

I will be meeting with the NRA who has endorsed me about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list or the no fly list to buy guns.

The press is so totally biased that we have no choice but to take our tough but fair and smart message directly to the people!

An: Media fell all over themselves criticizing what DonaldTrump "may have insinuated about POTUS." But he's right: 

HAPPY 241st BIRTHDAY to the @USArmy! THANK YOU! 

Thank you to the LGBT community! I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs.

AMERICA FIRST!

American must now get very tough very smart and very vigilant. We cannot admit people into our country without extraordinary screening.

Join me in Atlanta on Wednesday- at noon! #Trump2016 Tickets: 

Crooked Hillary says we must call on Saudi Arabia and other countries to stop funding hate. I am calling on- cont'd: 

Saudi Arabia and many of the countries that gave vast amounts of money to the Clinton Foundation- cont'd: 

I thought people werent celebrating? They were cheering all over even this savage from Orlando. I was right. 

In my speech on protecting America I spoke about a temporary ban which includes suspending immigration from nations tied to Islamic terror.

Based on the incredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting of the record setting Trump campaign we are hereby:  

I am no fan of President Obama but to show you how dishonest the phony Washington Post is: 

Anyone who plans to talk about Trump ever again has to see this speech.  Your opinion is irrelevant unless you listened

TERRORISM IMMIGRATION AND NATIONAL SECURITY SPEECH- TRANSCRIPT: 

I am watching FoxNews and how fairly they are treating me and my words and CNN and the total distortion of my words and what I am saying

I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror. Hillary just broke-said she would now use!

What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough

Please make us safe. We cannot have Hillary as president. We will be in so much trouble.

Reporting that Orlando killer shouted "Allah hu Akbar!" as he slaughtered clubgoers. 2nd man arrested in LA with rifles near Gay parade.

Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace!

Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism I don't want congrats I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!

Horrific incident in FL. Praying for all the victims & their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough smart & vigilant?

Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame!

Really bad shooting in Orlando. Police investigating possible terrorism. Many people dead and wounded.

Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas pretended to be a Native American in order to advance her career. Very racist!

Riley Rone was a great young man. We will miss him dearly. 

Thank you to our amazing law enforcement officers! #AmericaFirst 

Thank you Tampa Florida! #AmericaFirst #TrumpTrain 

Sad case- USATODAY did article saying I don't pay bills- false only don't pay when work is shoddy bad or not done! They should do same!

In Tampa Florida- thank you to all of our outstanding volunteers who want to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 

Don King and so many other African Americans who know me well and endorsed me would not have done so if they thought I was a racist!

Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist-but I am least racist person there is

Trump's Historic 13 Million Primary Votes.

How long did it take your staff of 823 people to think that up--and where are your 33000 emails that you deleted? 

A message of condolences and support regarding the terrorist attacks in Tel Aviv:  

Obama just endorsed Crooked Hillary. He wants four more years of Obamabut nobody else does!

Crooked Hillary Clinton will be a disaster on jobs the economy trade healthcare the military guns and just about all else. Obama plus!

As expected the media is very much against me. Their dishonesty is amazing but just like our big wins in the primaries we will win!

Bernie Sanders must really dislike Crooked Hillary after the way she played him. Many of his supporters because of trade will come to me.

I would have had many millions of votes more than Crooked Hillary Clinton except for the fact that I had 16 opponents she had one!

Senator Sanders spent more than me yet lost.

THE PEOPLE NEED TRUMP2 make USA RICH!

Number one presidency of all time

Top RINO hack for MSNBC Joey Scarborough on the air and calling the next President Trump a racist and bigot. Shame on you

Nobody is watching Morning Joe anymore. Gone off the deep end - bad ratings. You won't believe what I am watching now!

Vote for me at least you'll have a job.

Thank you to all for your wonderful comments on my speech. I could feel the electricity in thr air. Great reviews - most votes ever recieved

In just out book Secret Service Agent Gary Byrne doesn't believe that Crooked Hillary has the temperament or integrity to be the president!

A former Secret Service Agent for President Clinton excoriates Crooked Hillary describing her as ERRATIC & VIOLENT. Bad temperament for pres

See when I said NATO was obsolete because of no terrorism protection they made the change without giving me credit.

My next project is pretty amazing!

Remembering the fallen heroes on DDay. 

I am getting bad marks from certain pundits because I have a small campaign staff. But small is good flexible save money and number one!

A massive blow to Obama's message - only 38000 new jobs for month in just issued jobs report. That's REALLY bad!

Crooked Hillary is being badly criticized (for a Wall Street paid for ad) by PolitiFact for a false ad on me on women. She is a total fraud!

Crooked Hillary Clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months. Her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions!

Just like I have been able to spend far less money than  others on the campaign and finish #1 so too should our country. We can be great!

People at NBC report on my campaign but have zero access. They say what they want without any knowledge.True of so much of media!

Hillary Clinton is unfit to be president. She has bad judgement poor leadership skills and a very bad and destructive track record. Change!

I am watching CNN very little lately because they are so biased against me. Shows are predictable garbage! CNN and MSM is one big lie!

The Clinton News Network sometimes referred to as @CNN is getting more and more biased.They act so indignant-hear them behind closed doors

Our ineffective POTUS has to make a speech in Elkhart to make everything look great.n

Thank you Attorney General Gonzales so many people feel this way.  

We just had the worst jobs report since 2010.

The Mayor of San Jose did a terrible job of ordering the  protection of innocent people. The thugs were lucky supporters remained peaceful!

Many of the thugs that attacked the peaceful Trump supporters in San Jose were illegals. They burned the American flag and laughed at police.

Heres The HILLARY UNIVERSITY Scandal No One In The Media Is Talking About 

Muhammad Ali is dead at 74! A truly great champion and a wonderful guy. He will be missed by all!

Great evening in San Jose other than the thugs. My supporters are far tougher if they want to be but fortunately they are not hostile.

So much interest in my visit to Scotland! I greatly look forward to attending the opening event @TrumpTurnberry- taking place on June 24th.

I'm a former chief of police in a border town. I'm Hispanic I'm proud to be Hispanic and I'm 100% behind Trump." 

In Crooked Hillary's telepromter speech yesterday she made up things that I said or believe but have no basis in fact. Not honest!

I don't watch or do @Morning_Joe anymore. Small audience low ratings! I hear Mika has gone wild with hate. Joe is Joe. They lost their way!

Rally last night in San Jose was great. Tremendous love and enthusiasm in the hall. Big crowd. Outside small group of thugs burned Am flag!

Terrible jobs report just reported. Only 38000 jobs added. Bombshell!

I think the first female president of the USA will be Ivanka Trump a beautiful intelligent young genuine successful lady!

She's a criminal and I'm the only person that can stop her.

THIS IS @POTUS'S LEGACY! AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER!!! WE NEED to MAGA now! 

A vote for Trump is a vote to restore our great country.

A 60% increase in Texas Blue Cross/Blue Shield through ObamaCare. I told you so there is panic and anger as healthcare costs explode!

So great to have the endorsement and support of Paul Ryan. We will both be working very hard to Make America Great Again!

Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton! Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn't even look presidential!

Crooked Hillary no longer has credibility - too much failure in office. People will not allow another four years of incompetence!

Crooked Hillary Clinton who I would love to call Lyin' Hillary is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions.

After the litigation is disposed of and the case won I have instructed my execs to open Trump U(?) so much interest in it! I will be pres.

Even though I have a very biased and unfair judge in the Trump U civil case in San Diego I have thousands of great reviews & will win case!

With all of the Crooked Hillary Clinton's foreign policy experience she has made so many mistakes - and I mean real monsters! No more HRC.

Join me in San Jose California- tonight! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 Tickets: 

Wow USA Today did todays cover story on my record in lawsuits. Verdict: 450 wins 38 losses. Isn't that what you want for your president?

Do you ever notice that CNN gives me very little proper representation on my policies. Just watched-nobody knew anything about my foreign P

Bernie Sanders was right when he said that Crooked Hillary Clinton was not qualified to be president because she suffers from BAD judgement!

Crooked Hillary Clinton has zero natural talent - she should not be president. Her temperament is bad and her decision making ability-zilch!

Same failing New York Times "reporter" who wrote discredited women's story last week wrote another terrible story on me today- will never learn!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is a fraud who has put the public and country at risk by her illegal and very stupid use of e-mails. Many missing!

So I raised/gave $5600000 for the veterans and the media makes me look bad! They do anything to belittle - totally biased.

Congratulations to Sean Hannity on his tremendous increase in television ratings. Speaking of ratings- I will be on his show tonight

I am getting great credit for my press conference today. Crooked Hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days.

Katie Couric the third rate reporter who has been largely forgotten should be ashamed of herself for the fraudulent editing of her doc.

So many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money I raised/gave! It was my great honor - they do an amazing job.

Just finished a press conference in Trump Tower wherein I gave information on which VETERANS groups got the $5600000 that I raised/gave!

I have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great VETERANS and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so. Watch!

So many great things happening - new poll numbers looking good! News conference at 11:00 A.M. today Trump Tower!

I should have easily won the Trump University case on summary judgement but have a judge Gonzalo Curiel who is totally biased against me.

I have a judge in the Trump University civil case Gonzalo Curiel (San Diego) who is very unfair. An Obama pick. Totally biased-hates Trump

I hope everyone had a great Memorial Day!

I would have had millions of votes more in the primaries (than Crooked Hillary) if I only had one opponent instead of sixteen. Broke record

Have a great Memorial Day and remember that we will soon MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Illegals are taken care of better than our veterans.  

The endorsement of me by the 16500 Border Patrol Agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate. Nice!

In getting the endorsement of the 16500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you) the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary!

Obama says a WALL at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at W.H.

I will build the wall! That I can tell you!

I will build the wall! That I can tell you!

I will build the wall! That I can tell you!

I will build the wall! That I can tell you!

I will build the wall! That I can tell you!

If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent say good bye to the Supreme Court!

The Republican Party has to be smart & strong if it wants to win in November. Can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate!

Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser but if the GOP can't control their own then they are not a party. Be tough R's!

Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics- b/c I stand 100% behind everything we do.

Honor Memorial Day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country! We love them.

Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he's in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost. #MDW

Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me!

I am always on the front page of the failing New York Times but when I won the GOP nomination I'm in the back of the paper. Very dishonest!

The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money & get much better results! What we need as Prez!

The failing New York Times wrote a story about my management style & that I don't have many people. I have 73 Hillary has 800- & I'm beating her.

I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary - by a lot - and with many states left to go! Thank you.

The U.S. has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders. How nice but what do we get? NOT ENOUGH

Obama administration fails to screen Syrian refugees' social media accounts: 

Fantastic job on handling the thugs who tried to disrupt our very peaceful and well attended rally. Greatly appreciated!

Thank you Billy Joel. Many friends just told me you gave a very kind shoutout at MSG. Appreciate it- love your music!

Wow- 25000 in San Diego California! Thank you!!  

AN AMERICA FIRST ENERGY PLAN #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Poll data shows that Marco Rubio does by far the best in holding onto his Senate seat in Florida. Important to keep the MAJORITY. Run Marco!

Today we together won the Republican Nomination for President! 

My wife MELANIA TRUMP and my children will be featured on FoxNews

I find it offensive that Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas pretended to be Native American to get in Harvard.

Thank you Mr. & Mrs. Tom Barrack Jr for the wonderful and magical evening last night. It will not be forgotten.

The Inspector General's report on Crooked Hillary Clinton is a disaster. Such bad judgement and temperament cannot be allowed in the W.H.

Thank you Anaheim California! #Trump2016 

Thank you Washington! Honored to say on behalf of our great movement we have broken the all time record for votes in GOP primary history.

The protesters in New Mexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican flag. The rally inside was big and beautiful but outside criminals!

Crooked Hillary Clinton just can't close the deal with Bernie. I had to knock out 16 very good and smart candidates. Hillary doesn't have it

Goofy Senator Elizabeth Warren @elizabethforma has done less in the U.S. Senate than practically any other senator. All talk no action!

Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes known as Pocahontas bought foreclosed housing and made a quick killing. Total hypocrite!

Great rally in New Mexico amazing crowd! Now in L.A. Big rally in Anaheim.

After raising w/ no obligation almost $6M for Vets I couldn't believe protesters formed @ Trump Tower. JUST OUT- SENT BY CROOKED HILLARY!

I blame the dishonest media.

A wonderfully written article concerning Israel. 

A great new book has been written about Crooked Hillary. Read it & you will never be able to vote for her.

My favorite book is the bible, and second favorite Art of the Deal.

Crooked Hillary Clinton overregulates overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs. Most importantly she suffers from plain old bad judgement!

I just released my financial disclosure forms the largest numbers in the history of the F.E.C. Even the dishonest media thinks great!

Amazingly with all of the money I have raised for the vets I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media.

Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups.

While under no obligation to do so I have raised between 5 & 6 million dollars including 1million dollars from me for our VETERANS. Nice!

Obamas VA Secretary just said we shouldn't measure wait times. Hillary says VA problems are not widespread. I will take care of our vets!

Is Hillary really protecting women? 

In trade military and EVERYTHING else it will be AMERICA FIRST! This will quickly lead to our ultimate goal: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

The American people are sick and tired of not being able to lead normal lives and to constantly be on the lookout for terror and terrorists!

Bernie Sanders is continuing his quest because he believes that Crooked Hillary Clinton will be forced out of the race - e-mail scandal!

Crooked Hillary wants a radical 500% increase in Syrian refugees. We cant allow this. Time to get smart and protect America!

How can Crooked Hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical Islam which horribly oppresses women?

BREAKING POLL: Trump Gains 11 Points on Clinton Since March. Now Leads Crooked Hillary 46-44 

Why do the networks continue to put dopey Bill Kristol on panels when he has called every single shot about me wrong for 2 yrs?

Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad! Would be four more years of stupidity!

Crooked Hillary said that I  want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong!

I WILL do the right thing for the U.S.A without a doubt.

Thank you to all of the men and women who have served our country. You are our true heroes! #ArmedForcesDay 

Crooked Hillary Clintons foreign interventions unleashed ISIS in Syria Iraq and Libya. She is reckless and dangerous!

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

CNN is so negative getting even worse as I get closer. Just had two anti-Trump losers with zero rebuttal from my team. Turning off!

Hillary wants to rip the guns out of America's hands. No guns = no protection. Get on #TrumpTrain & join NRA to stop her.

Crooked Hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed. No more guns to protect Hillary!

While our wonderful president was out playing golf all day the TSA is falling apart just like our government! Airports a total disaster!

Crooked Hillary is spending tremendous amounts of Wall Street money on false ads against me. She is a very dishonest person!

Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment. No gun owner can ever vote for Clinton!

Colin great to have you at Trump Turnberry. So proud of you and your GREAT playing! You made winning MAJORS look easy!

Best Links Course in Britain. Ailsa Course opens June '16 Can't wait to play it 

We will not disappoint!

Great day in Kentucky with Wayne LaPierre and the NRA!  

Failing New York Times will always take a good story about me and make it bad. Every article is unfair and biased. Very sad!

Trump is the most unpredictable extraordinary entertaining & massively popular candidate this country has ever seen.

I am on my way! See you all soon! 

Crooked Hillary can't even close the deal with Bernie - and the Dems have it rigged in favor of Hillary. Four more years of this? No way!

Crooked Hillary Clinton looks presidential? I don't think so! Four more years of Obama and our country will never come back. ISIS LAUGHS!

Look where the world is today a total mess and ISIS is still running around wild. I can fix it fast Hillary has no chance!

Crooked Hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina. ISIS China Russia and all would love for her to be president. 4 more years!

I said that Crooked Hillary Clinton is "not qualified" to be president because she has "very bad judgement" - Bernie said the same thing!

Looks like yet another terrorist attack. Airplane departed from Paris. When will we get tough smart and vigilant? Great hate and sickness!

My list of potential U.S. Supreme Court Justices was very well recieved. During the next number of weeks I may be adding to the list!

Some low-life journalist claims that I "made a pass" at her 29 years ago. Never happened! Like the @nytimes story which has become a joke!

Why did Clinton supporters declare Crooked Hillary winner in KY when AP hasn't even called the race?

Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Democrats - the system is rigged against him. Many of his disenfranchised fans are for me!

Paul Begala the dopey CNN flunky and head of the Pro-Hillary Clinton Super PAC has knowingly committed fraud in his first ad against me.

Trump for President! Bernie is a joke knows nothing - and Hillary is yesterday's and today's nightmare

The Trump movement will not be stopped. We support Trump because he is a true American looking out for #AmericaFIRST.

Congratulations to THE MOVEMENT we have just won THE GREAT STATE OF OREGON. The vote percentage is even higher than anticipated! Thank you.

Hillary Just Handed me a huge Gift. Promising to Put Bubba in Charge of the Economy!

No way I believe Trump at 70% disapproval with women. Went to 3 rallies. At least 1/2 women. MSM Lies! MSM Lies!

Michael Barbaro the author of the now discredited New York Times hit piece on me with women has in past tweeted badly about me. He should resign

He will destroy Hillary but why give CNN record breaking ratings CNN can go to hell. Trump 2016

I look so forward to debating Crooked Hillary Clinton! Democrat Primaries are rigged e-mail investigation is rigged - so time to get it on!

I can't believe that @CNN would allow the very nice Jeffrey Lord to be savaged by a panel of seven Trump haters. 7 to 1 - Don't watch CNN!

I am a pillar of strength and will be perfect as our next president

Well that is it. Well done Megyn --- and they all lived happily ever after! Now let us all see how "THE MOVEMENT" does in Oregon tonight!

Will go back on for a final question now! Amazing job

Great interview! Happy you had a chance to show the other side. Never change never forget you are our messenger!

I like Michael Douglas!

I like Michael Douglas!

I like Michael Douglas!

Best interview that I have ever seen.

One thing we know for sure Bernie Sanders supporters will turn to #Trump - absolutely not HillaryClinton

I speak from the heart for all of America. His intention is for a positive future for all. 

Wall Street paid for ad is a fraud just like Crooked Hillary! Their main line had nothing to do with women and they knew it. Apologize?

Do you think Crooked Hillary will finally close the deal? If she can't win Kentucky she should drop out of race. System rigged! 

I look forward to watching Megan Kelly. It will be interesting to see how she treats me. I think she will be very fair.

How can Crooked Hillary put her husband in charge of the economy when he was responsible for NAFTA the worst economic deal in U.S. history?

Crooked Hillary said her husband is going to be in charge of the economy.If so he should runnot her.Will he bring the "energizer" to D.C.?

Crooked Hillary can't close the deal with Bernie Sanders. Will be another bad day for her!

Amazing that Crooked Hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the WORST abuser of woman in U.S. political history

Oregon is voting today. Keep the big numbers going - VOTE TRUMP! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women. Can't believe she would misrepresent the facts! My hit was on China

The pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. "You can tell them to go BLANK themselves" - was about China NOT WOMEN!

Wow 30000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar! How can she run?

Wow 30000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar! How can she run?

Wow 30000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar! How can she run?

What Barbara Res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly and for years trying to come back. I said no.

I gave a woman named Barbara Res a top N.Y. construction job when that was unheard of and now she is nasty. So much for a nice thank you!

In politics and in life ignorance is not a virtue." This is a primary reason that President Obama is the worst president in U.S. history!

The writer of the now proven false story in the New York Times Michael Barbaro who was interviewed on CBS this morning was unable to respond.

Over 50 women were interviewed by the New York Times yet they only wrote about 6. Thats because there were so many positive statements.

No wonder the New York Times is failing who can believe what they write after the false malicious & libelous story they did on me.

The failing New York Times is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women. 

With the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing New York Times hit piece on me we have exposed the article as a fraud!

A political commentator for CNN which I no longer watch said "Trump showed some weakness in the Repub Primaries." I set all-time record!

The New York Times is so dishonest. Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer who said it was a lie!

That was an amazing interview on Fox and Friends - I hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the New York Times is!

Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Dems. The system is rigged against him. He should run as an independent! Run Bernie run.

The Washington Post report on potential VP candidates is wrong. Marco Rubio and most others mentioned are NOT under consideration.

Thank you Georgia! See you soon! #Trump2016 

The media is really on a witch-hunt against me. False reporting and plenty of it - but we will prevail!

Why did the failing New York Times refuse to use any of the names given to them that I was so proud to have helped with their careers. DISHONEST!

Wow I have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing New York Times piece. Massive front page for that!

Why doesn't the failing New York Times write the real story on the Clintons and women? The media is TOTALLY dishonest!

New York Times keep shining....the ppl will not let the media dim your light...we no longer believe them! #Trump2016" Thanks.

Everyone continues to pile onto me but they can NEVER take away our votes!"  Thank you!

Everyone is laughing at the New York Times for the lame hit piece they did on me and women.I gave them many names of women I helped-refused to use

OHIO WOMEN FOR TRUMP 

OHIO WOMEN FOR TRUMP 

OHIO WOMEN FOR TRUMP 

OHIO WOMEN FOR TRUMP 

We seem to have the same trajectory both were written off but they keep scaling the heights. History?

The failing New York Times wrote yet another hit piece on me. All are impressed with how nicely I have treated women they found nothing. A joke!

Wow CNN is really working hard to make me look as bad  as possible. Very unprofessional. Hurting in ratings - bad television! Great new poll- thank you! 

If Crooked Hillary Clinton can't close the deal on Crazy Bernie how is she going to take on China Russia ISIS and all of the others?

An incredible honor to receive the endorsement of a person I have such tremendous respect for. Thank you Sheldon! 

Your story about me & the carbon tax is absolutely incorrect. It is just the opposite. I will not support or endorse a carbon tax!

Senator Lindsey Graham called me yesterday very much to my surprise and we had a very interesting talk about national security and more!

If it were up to goofy Elizabeth Warren wed have no jobs in Americashe doesnt have a clue.

In interview I told AP that my taxes are under routine audit and I would release my tax returns when audit is complete not after election!

Isnt it funny when a failed Senator like goofy Elizabeth Warren can spend a whole day tweeting about Trump & gets nothing done in Senate?

Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage. See mediaasking for increase!

Our Native American Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren couldnt care less about the American workerdoes nothing to help!

Goofy Elizabeth Warren is now using the womans card like her friend crooked Hillary. See her dumb tweet when a woman stands up to you

If the people of Massachusetts found out what an ineffective Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren has been she would lose! Thanks Piers. 

'Duck Dynasty' star Phil Robertson says he'll back Trump for president 

Goofy Elizabeth Warren didnt have the guts to run for POTUS. Her phony Native American heritage stops that and VP cold.

Goofy Elizabeth Warren has been one of the least effective Senators in the entire U.S. Senate. She has done nothing!

I don't want to hit Crazy Bernie Sanders too hard yet because I love watching what he is doing to Crooked Hillary. His time will come!

Big wins in West Virginia and Nebraska. Get ready for November - Crooked Hillary who is looking very bad against Crazy Bernie will lose!

The Clintons spend millions on negative ads on me & I cant tell the truth about her husband? Dont feel sorry for crooked Hillary!

Hillary has bad judgment! 

It was so great being in Nebraska last week. Today is the big day--get out and vote!

I look very much forward to meeting w/Paul Ryan & the GOP Party Leadership on Thurs in DC. Together we will beat the Dems at all levels!

It is only the people that were never asked to be VP that tell the press that they will not take the position.

It was Rosie O'Donnell who ate the cake in the vicious Hillary commercial about me not Crooked Hillary!

Why does the media with a strong push from Crooked Hillary keep pushing the false narrative that I want to raise taxes. Exactly opposite!

Great job on Fox and Friends this morning. Thank you for the nice words!

For Our Children: Let's Elect Donald Trump 

I am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate. Any negotiated increase by Congress to my proposal would still be lower than current!

I will have set the all time record in primary votes in the Republican party --despite having to compete against 17 other people!

If I only had 1 person running against me in the primaries like Hillary Clinton I would have gotten 10 million more votes than she did!

Crooked Hillary Clinton says that she got more primary votes than Donald Trump. But I had 17 people to beatshe had one!  A nasty guy with no heart!

Is Chris serious lying or misinformed? Bill Clinton signed NAFTA. 

The liars that signed the pledge and now won't support me. The reason they are losers. A nasty guy with no heart!

Wow I hear Morning Joe has gone really hostile ever since I said I won't do or watch the show anymore.They misrepresent my positions!

Russell Moore is truly a terrible representative of Evangelicals and all of the good they stand for. A nasty guy with no heart!


Crooked Hillary just can't close the deal with Bernie. It will be the same way with ISIS and China on trade and Mexico at the border. Bad!

Kellyanne you were fantastic on Meet The Press today. Keep going - I will win for the people. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! HappyMothersDay!  

Kellyanne you were fantastic on Meet The Press today. Keep going - I will win for the people. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! HappyMothersDay! 

Kellyanne you were fantastic on Meet The Press today. Keep going - I will win for the people. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! HappyMothersDay! 

I want a leader that will shoot straight with us. The politicians can't.

Remember when the two failed presidential candidates Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush signed a binding PLEDGE? They broke the deal no honor!

I am honored that the great men and women of the @Teamsters have created a movement from within called Teamsters for Trump! Thank you.

I am going to keep our jobs in the U.S. and totally rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. Crooked Hillary has no clue! @Teamsters

Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk no action -- maybe her Native American name?

Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts.

Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me.

Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant but leaves behind amazing legacy.

Goofy Elizabeth Warren Hillary Clintons flunky has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American.

Lets properly check goofy Elizabeth Warrens records to see if she is Native American. I say shes a fraud!

I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.

I hear JoeNBC of rapidly fading Morning_Joe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run. This will guarantee a Crooked Hillary win.

Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed then John Kasich and that didn't work. Not much power or insight!

Thank you to teachers across America! When I become POTUS we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now.

Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability. As Bernie Sanders says she has bad judgement. Constantly playing the women's card - it is sad!

Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special the Republican Party. Wrong I didn't inherit it I won it with millions of voters! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill.

Many would say that you are the only talented person running for the top job this time!

So many great endorsements yesterday except for Paul Ryan! We must put America first and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill.

Governor Rick Perry said "Donald Trump is one of the most talented people running for the Presidency I've ever seen." Thank you Rick!

Unlike crooked Hillary Clinton who wants to destroy all miners I want wages to go up in America. We will do so by bringing back jobs! I love Hispanics! 

Thank you West Virginia. Let's keep it going. Go out and vote on Tuesday - we will win big. #Trump2016

Can you believe Crooked Hillary said "We are going to put a whole lot of coal miners&coal companies out of business." She then apologized. I love Hispanics! 

Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats. Both with delegates & otherwise. He should show them & run as an Independent.

Happy #CincoDeMayo! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! 

I love Hispanics!

I love Hispanics! 

I love Hispanics! 

I will be interviewed by @BretBaier @SpecialReport at 6pm ET tonight @FoxNews

Many reports that I will be attending the Alvarez/Khan fight this weekend in Vegas. Totally untrue! Unfortunately I have other plans.

The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill.

I would rather run against Crooked Hillary Clinton than Bernie Sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against Bernie!

What a great evening we had. So interesting that Sanders beat Crooked Hillary. The dysfunctional system is totally rigged against him!

Please correct I WON Virginia!

Thank you Indiana we were just projected to be the winner. We have won in every category. You are very special people-I will never forget!

Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will and must win Indiana. If he doesn't he should drop out of the race-stop wasting time & money.

Wow Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure - not very presidential. Sad!

I will be campaigning in Indiana all day. Things are looking great and the support of Bobby Knight has been so amazing. Today will be fun!

Everybody is talking about the protesters burning the American flags and proudly waving Mexican flags. I want America First - so do voters!

Gov Mike Pence has just stated that Donald Trump has taken a strong stance on Hoosier jobs and he thanks me! I will bring back jobs to USA.

Crooked Hillary Clinton said she is used to "dealing with men who get off the reservation." Actually she has done poorly with such men!

Karl Rove is a failed Jeb Bushy. Never says anything good & never will even after I beat Hillary. Shouldn't be on the air!

I am on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace- his 20th year anniversary with Fox News! 

I watched Sen. Graham Face The Nation. Why don't they say that I ran him out of the race like a little boy and in the end he had no support? Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will and must win Indiana. If he doesn't he should drop out of the race-stop wasting time & money.

Wow Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure - not very presidential. Sad! 

The economy is bad and getting worse-almost ZERO growth this quarter. Nobody can beat me on the economy (and jobs). MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

The "protesters" in California were thugs and criminals. Many are professionals. They should be dealt with strongly by law enforcement!

Anderson so amazing. Your mother is and always has been an incredible woman!

We are now at 1001 delegates. We will win on the first ballot and are not wasting time and effort on other ballots because system is rigged!

Crooked Hillary Clinton perhaps the most dishonest person to have ever run for the presidency is also one of the all time great enablers!

Wow the ridiculous deal made between Lyin'Ted Cruz and 1 for 42 John Kasich has just blown up. What a dumb deal - dead on arrival!

New York Yankees President Randy Levine: 'End of the Republican Party' If Donald Trump Not Nominated.   

So many false and phony T.V. commercials being broadcast in Indiana. Reminds me of Florida where thousands were put up-I won in a landslide!

I will be in Evansville Indiana with the great Bobby Knight (who last night endorsed me) at 12:00 this afternoon. See you there!

Lyin' Ted Cruz who can never beat Hillary Clinton and has NO path to victory has chosen a V.P.candidate who failed badly in her own effort

Thank you to all for the wonderful reviews of my foreign policy speech. I will soon be speaking in great detail on numerous other topics!

Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will and must win Indiana. If he doesn't he should drop out of the race-stop wasting time & money.

Wow Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure - not very presidential. Sad!

I cried when they said you made a clean sweep of all 5 states. I was SO HAPPY!

Getting the strong endorsement of the great coach Bobby Knight has been a highlight of my stay in Indiana. Big speech tomorrow with Bobby!

I am in Indiana where we just had a great rally. Fantastic people! Staying at a Holiday Inn Express - new and clean not bad! Thank you Laura!  

Thank you for the endorsement Coach Bobby Knight! I will never forget it! Thank you Newt! Thanks Dave! 

GREATEST FOREIGN POLICY SPEECH SINCE WASHINGTON'S FAREWELL ADDRESS.

Lets #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Maryland! #VoteTrump  

How bad is the New York Times the most inaccurate coverage constantly. Always trying to belittle. Paper has lost its way!

Thank you for the incredible support- Melania Barron Ivanka Jared Tiffany Don Vanessa Eric and Lara! 

Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democratsboth with delegates & otherwise. He should show them and run as an Independent! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

The Cruz-Kasich pact is under great strain. This joke of a deal is falling apart not being honored and almost dead. Very dumb!

Passing what was once a vibrant manufacturing area in Pennsylvania. So sad! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  

On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night!

Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work.

Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.

Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!

Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!

Wow just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!

I am happy to hear how badly the New York Times is doing. It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down. Becoming irrelevant!

I will be in Maryland this afternoon for a major rally. Things are looking good for Tuesday!

As soon as John Kasich is hit with negative ads he will drop like a rock in the polls against Crooked Hillary Clinton. I will win!

I had a great day campaigning in Connecticut. Looking for a big vote on Tuesday!

Congratulations to Sean Hannity on his great ratings and ratings increase as reported by the AP today. Amazing job!

Lynne Ryan -- just read your great story in the NY Times -- I am proud of you. Thanks! 

Cast your vote for Trump for POTUS & ALSO vote for the TRUMP DELEGATES in your congressional district! 

Will be spending the day campaigning in Connecticut another state where jobs are being stolen by other countries. I will stop this fast!

I met Prince on numerous occasions. He was an amazing talent and wonderful guy. He will be greatly missed!

Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted.

Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!

Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!

Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!

I will be doing the @TODAYshow with my wife Melania and the rest of my family in a major Town Hall. Hopefully it will be fun! Enjoy.7A.M.

We are going to bring steel and manufacturing back to Indiana!

Had a meeting with the terrific @GovPenceIN of Indiana. So excited to campaign in his wonderful state! 

Ted Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race. Now all he can do is be a spoiler never a nice thing to do. I will beat Hillary! 

CNN is so negative it is impossible to watch. Terrible panel angry haters.    

1988 with Oprah, I discuss why I would never rule out a run for POTUS.

Who did the House Task Force on Urgent Fiscal Issues call- when America needed HELP?  

Lyin Ted Cruz even voted against Superstorm Sandy aid and September 11th help. So many New Yorkers devastated. Cruz hates New York!

New York we will make America great again! 

Kasich only looks O.K. in polls against Hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed ZERO negative ads against him

Lyin' Ted Cruz can't win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bosses-I am millions of VOTES ahead! Hillary would destroy him & Kasich

I will fix this corrupted rigged system. 4 no Profit Under budget & ahead of schedule.

I would have millions of votes more than Hillary except for the fact that I had 17 opponents and she just had a socialist named Bernie!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. I am the one person she doesn't want to run against. Will be such fun!

Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses. It won't work!

Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary. Despite a rigged delegate system I am hundreds of delegates ahead of him.

I'll be in one of my favorite places this morning Staten Island. Big crowd will be fun!

New CBS Poll shows defections from Cruz's core supporters & increased support for me. Not surprising.

I'm starting to believe that I'm actually going to WIN!

Just arrived in Syracuse NY. Big crowd great place! We will bring back the desperately needed jobs. #NYPrimary 

We are becoming a third world country because of jerks like him" Great! We are becoming a third world country because of jerks like him" Great!

We are becoming a third world country because of jerks like him" Great! Finally someone who actually cares about us!! 

Big protest march in Colorado on Friday afternoon! Don't let the bosses take your vote!

The rules DID CHANGE in Colorado shortly after I entered the race in June because the pols and their bosses knew I would win with the voters

Biggest story in politics is now happening in the great State of Colorado where over one million people have been precluded from voting!

Missouri just confirmed #Trump2016 as the official winner- with an additional 12 delegates. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

Leaving for Albany New York now massive crowd expected. Very exciting!

Why does the liberal media think Bill O'Reilly is a complete and total vulgarian? I don't think so!

Why does the liberal media think Bill O'Reilly is a complete and total vulgarian? I don't think so!

Colorado Trump Delegates Scratched from Ballots at GOP Convention 

This is happening all over our countrygreat people being disenfranchised by politicians. Repub party is in trouble! 

The people of Colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians. Biggest story in politics. This will not be allowed!

How is it possible that the people of the great State of Colorado never got to vote in the Republican Primary? Great anger - totally unfair!

I win a state in votes and then get non-representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign. Bad system!

The New York Times purposely covers me so inaccurately. I want other nations to pay the U.S. for our defense of them. We are the suckers-no more!

New Jersey Man Joseph Hornick Willing to Go to Jail for Flying Trump Flag

GOP is trying to steal nomination from the winner not block an insurgent catching up 2 frontrunner (Sanders).

I am the only person who can save us from this corrupt political mess. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Women love Mr Trump too. Will make it happen in New York on April 19. Go out & vote.

Bernie Sanders says that Hillary Clinton is unqualified to be president. Based on her decision making ability I can go along with that!

Isn't it a shame that the person who will have by far the most delegates and many millions more votes than anyone else me still must fight

Trump will be our best president since Reagan! Nobody beats me on National Security. Looks like I was right about NATO. I had no doubt. 

Jennifer is a terrific person. Trump Cruz is hated in New York. He should go home - no place for a phony. Ted Cruz attacked New Yorkers and New York values- we don't forget! 

Jennifer is a terrific person. Trump Cruz is hated in New York. He should go home - no place for a phony. Ted Cruz attacked New Yorkers and New York values- we don't forget! 

Unbelievable evening. Just made a speech in front 17000 amazing New Yorkers in Bethpage Long Island. Great to be home! Pure fiction!

It is so great to be back home! Looking forward to a great rally tonight in Bethpage Long Island!

Wow Politico is in total disarray  with almost everybody quitting. Good news. Bad dishonest journalists! 

DonaldTrump is the only guy I think that has the will & the nerve to attack & to fight. 

VERY close to my heart. I'm a NAVY VET! I love VETERANS ADMINISTRATION REFORMS. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Wow great news from Wisconsin. Just made two speeches there with a big one coming tonight. Thank you! 

A great day in Wisconsin many stops many great people! Melania is joining me on Monday. Big crowds. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I don't care about the game I care about the PEOPLE. And that's exactly why WE THE PEOPLE love you so much! #Trump2016

CNN is reviewing the weekbut majority of the show about me because there would be 0.0 ratings if not. Media's a JOKE. Enjoy!

Thank you for your nice words on Fox today. They never use my full statements on nuclear which you would agree with!

Great honor to have GOP General Counsel John Ryder as a Trump delegate in TN. RNC meeting well worth it! Unifying the party!

Wisconsin has suffered a great loss of jobs and trade but if I win all of the bad things happening in the U.S. will be rapidly reversed!

I will be in Wisconsin until the election. Jobs trade and immigration will be big factors. I will bring jobs back home - make great deals!

If Megan Kelly stopped covering me on her show her ratings would drop like a rock! My h to h interview with Anderson Cooper beat her by millions! Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? 

Is it possible for Megan Kelly to cover anyone but Donald Trump on her terrible show. She totally misrepresents my words and positions! BAD. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! BAD.

Can you believe that Ted Cruz who has been killing our country on trade for so long just put out a Wisconsin ad talking about trade? We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States! 

We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States!

We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States!

We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States! We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States! Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? 

For the 1st time in American history Americas 16500 border patrol agents have issue a presidential primary endorsementme! Thank you.

The National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) said that our open border is the biggest physical & economic threat facing the American people! Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? 

The Club For Growth said in their ad that 465 delegates (Cruz) plus 143 delegates (Kasich) is more than my 739 delegates. Try again! Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? 

The Club For Growth which asked me for $10000 in an extortion attempt just put up a Wisconsin ad with incorrect math.What a dumb group! Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? 

Just had a very nice meeting with Reince Priebus and the @GOP. Looking forward to bringing the Party together and it will happen! The Trump Doctrine: Peace Through Strength. Nothing you say will change my mind! Congratulations to CNN for having the wisdom to pick TRUMP! 

Nice piece and video today in the Wall Street Journal: Trumps three eldest children jump into campaign 

David Gregory got thrown off of TV by NBC fired like a dog! Now he is on CNN being nasty to me. Not nice!

Final numbers's just announced in the GREAT State of MO. TRUMP WINS! New certified #'s show a 365 vote increase for me- @ least 12 more delegates!

Why is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference? What is in her hand?? 

Why is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference? What is in her hand??

Why is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference? What is in her hand??

This was the reporters statement- when she found out there was tape from my facility she changed her tune. 

Victory press conference was over.  Why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions? Can I press charges? 

Why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened that is before she found out the episode was on tape?

Wow Corey Lewandowski my campaign manager and a very decent man was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there!

How come the @TODAYshow & @chucktodd show the new @NBCNews Poll for Hillary vs Bernie but do not show the SAME poll where I am killing Cruz?

I have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC.

Wow CNN has nothing but my opponents on their shows. Really one-sided and unfair reporting. Maybe I shouldn't do their town-hall tonight!

We need to secure our borders ASAP. No games we must be smart tough and vigilant. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN & MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN!

Lyin' Ted I have already beaten you in all debates and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates. You should focus on jobs & illegal imm!

Lyin'Ted Cruz is weak & losing big so now he wants to debate again. But according to DrudgeTime and on-line polls I have won all debates

After the way I beat Gov. Scott Walker (and Jeb Rand Marco and all others) in the Presidential Primaries no way he would ever endorse me!

Cruz will say anything that is contrary to what you have to say. If you're for Motherhood he'll be against it!

Just released that international gangs are all over our cities. This will end when I am President!

Ted Cruz is incensed that I want to refocus NATO on terrorism as well as current mission but also want others to PAY FAIR SHARE a must!

A detainee released from Gitmo has killed an American. When will our so-called "leaders" ever learn!

The United States cannot continue to make such bad one-sided trade deals. There are only so many jobs we can give up. No more!

See Lyin' Ted even the DailyBeast says this story came from Rubio not Trump! 

Just to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than Cruz-Lawsuit coming

Why can't the pundits be honest? Hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again. I will make it strong and great!  JOBS!

Another radical Islamic attack this time in Pakistan targeting Christian women & children. At least 67 dead400 injured. I alone can solve

Happy Easter to all have a great day!

My statement on NATO being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive (and unfair) for the U.S. are now finally receiving plaudits!

Wow sleepy eyes Chuck Todd is at it again. He is do totally biased. The things I am saying are correct. - far better vision than the others

Remember I am the only candidate who is self-funding. While I am given little credit for this by the voters I am not bought like others!

Don't believe the Fox News Polls they are just another phony hit job on me. I will beat Hillary Clinton easily in the General Election.

Wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in U.S. jobs are leaving. I will make our economy strong again - bring in jobs

Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J. Trump. Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong. Illegals out!

Lyin' Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enq.were caused by me. I had NOTHING to do with story!

The press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women when they know that it is just the opposite!

The media is so after me on women  Wow this is a tough business. Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump!

Your instincts on foreign policy & terrorism have been better than all of these so called experienced politicians combined.

Top suspect in Paris massacre Salah Abdeslam who also knew of the Brussels attack is no longer talking. Weak leaders ridiculous laws!

Lyin Ted blames me for so many things I am starting to think he is having a mental health crisis.

Lyin Ted blames me for so many things I am starting to think he is having a mental health crisis.

Wow just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me. How am I still number one - by a lot?

I didn't start the fight with Lyin'Ted Cruz over the GQ cover pic of Melania he did. He knew the PAC was putting it out - hence Lyin' Ted!

Just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the Trump U case but the press refuses to write about it. If I lost-monster story! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Europe and the U.S. must immediately stop taking in people from Syria. This will be the destruction of civilization as we know it! So sad!

Just announced that as many as 5000 ISIS fighters have infiltrated Europe. Also many in U.S.  I TOLD YOU SO! I alone can fix this problem!

They're all brain-dead puppets with skeletons in their closet. I say you go on and destroy them all" A dead show

Explain how the women on The View which is a total disaster since the great Barbara Walters left ever got their jobs. @abc is wasting time

The View which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air is constantly asking me to go on.

The View which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air is constantly asking me to go on. I TELL THEM "NO

Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years. TIME FOR A CHANGE I WILL SOLVE AND FAST! Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years. TIME FOR A CHANGE I WILL SOLVE AND FAST!

It is amazing how often I am right only to be criticized by the media. Illegal immigration take the oil build the wall Muslims NATO!

Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a "hell hole" and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article. I was so right!

These politicians like Cruz and Graham who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years do nothing to make things better!

Lindsay Graham and Lyin' Ted Cruz are two politicians who are very much alike - ALL TALK AND NO ACTION! Both talk about ISIS do nothing!

It is amazing how Lindsey Graham gets on so many T.V. shows talking negatively about me when I beat him so badly in his pres run!

Thank God is not a politician but he's one heck of a fighter who will fight for us the people.

We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of N.A.T.O. Why? It is time to renegotiate and the time is now!

N.A.T.O. is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on!

I want to thank Joe for all of his help in our historic Arizona win. Could not have done it without you Joe!

While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race!

I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted. Jeb spent more than $1500000 and got nothing. I spent a fraction of that and am first!

I will be the best by far in fighting terror. Im the only one that was right from the beginning & now Lyin Ted & others are copying me.

Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror. Shes been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are!

Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates Lyin Ted Cruz. Honestly I cant blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion!

Lyin Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me and lines from Michael Douglas just another dishonest politician.

Thank you Arizona! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpTrain 

Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania. That's why we call him Lyin' Ted!

Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices!

Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona. Thank you I will never forget!

Incompetent Hillary despite the horrible attack in Brussels today wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in.  No way!

Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful Lyin' Ted or I will spill the beans on your wife!

Pres. Obama should leave the baseball game in Cuba immediately & get home to Washington- where a #POTUS under a serious emergency belongs!

Obama and all others have been so weak and so politically correct that terror groups are forming and getting stronger! Shame.

My heart & prayers go out to all of the victims of the terrible Brussels tragedy. This madness must be stopped and I will stop it.

Watch this clip from earlier this year. Time & time again I have been right about terrorism. Its time to get tough! 

I have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody- and its not even close. Hopefully AZ and UT will be voting for me today!

President Obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in Cuba especially in the shadows of Brussels. He is being treated badly!

Do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place Brussels was. Not anymore it is from a different world! U.S. must be vigilant and smart! The media is corrupt! We The People are fighting with you.

Wow President Obama just landed in Cuba a big deal and Raul Castro wasn't even there to greet him. He greeted Pope and others. No respect

Dont worry! They are losing thousands of viewers and money. Roger Ailes will be telling Megyn to stop.

So the highly overrated anchor Megan Kelly is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show but I can't fight back? Wrong!

The protesters blocked a major highway yesterday delaying entry to my RALLY in Arizona by hours and the media blames my supporters!

Why is it that the horrendous protesters who scream curse punch shut down roads/doors during my RALLIES  are never blamed by media? SAD!

The rallies in Utah and Arizona were great! Tremendous crowds and spirit. Just returned but will be going back soon.

You are a true journalistic professional. I so agree with what you say. Keep up the great work! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Watching your show from Arizona where we just had a big rally. It is fantastic- everybody loves it!

Wow @CNN ratings are up 75% because it's "all Trump all the time." The networks are making a fortune off of me! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

If crazy Megan Kelly didn't cover me so much on her terrible show her ratings would totally tank. She is so average in so many ways!

Crazy Megan Kelly says I don't (won't) go on her show and she still gets good ratings. But almost all of her shows are negative hits on me! LYIN' TED 

Honored to be in Utah with retired General Robert C. Oaks. We are so thankful for his support and endorsement here.

Reading New York times is a total waste of time he is a clown with no awareness of the world around him- dummy!

While I have never met New York Times of the NY Times I consider him one of the dumbest of all pundits- he has no sense of the real world!

Just leaving Salt Lake City Utah- fantastic crowd with no interruptions.  Love Utah. I will be back! Utah Speaker of the House announces endorses me! 

Why haven't they released the final Missouri victory for us yet? Could it be because Cruz's guy runs Missouri?

I guess I have reached yet another "ceiling"  - 49.7% with four people. My highest Reuters poll yet! Thank you! 

Do you believe that Hillary Clinton now wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants? She should spend more time taking care of our great Vets! LYIN' TED 

Everybody should boycott the Megan Kelly show. Never worth watching. Always a hit on Trump! She is sick & the most overrated person on tv.

Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost! Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary

Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost! Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary

Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost! Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary

Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney was campaigning with John Kasich & Marco Rubio and now he is endorsing Ted Cruz. 1/2

Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney the man who "choked" and let us all down is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz. This is good for me!

Going to Salt Lake City Utah for a big rally. Lyin' Ted Cruz should not be allowed to win there.  Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary. Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary

Club for Growth letter- trying to extort $10000.00 from me. Remember I said- NO! 

Club For Growth tried to extort $10000 from me. When I said NO they went hostile with negative ads. Disgraceful!

With millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment my numbers continue to go up. Can anyone explain this?

Eric Erickson got fired like a dog from RedState and now he is the one leading opposition against me.

Eric Erickson got fired like a dog from RedState and now he is the one leading opposition against me.

Eric Erickson got fired like a dog from RedState and now he is the one leading opposition against me.

Senator Lindsey Graham made horrible statements about Senator Ted Cruz  and then he endorsed him. No wonder nobody trusts politicians!

Lyin' Ted Cruz lost all five races on Tuesday-and he was just given the jinx - a Lindsey Graham endorsement. Also backed Jeb. Lindsey got 0!

Hillary Clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life!

Who should star in a reboot of Liar Liar- Hillary Clinton or Ted Cruz? Let me know. 

Highly overrated & crazy Megan Kelly is always complaining about Trump and yet she devotes her shows to me. Focus on others Megyn!

Looking like my 5 victories on Tuesday will be just as good as if I won Ohio. Two more days and Ohio was mine!

Please explain to the dummies at the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board that I love to debate and have won according to Drudge etc. all 11 of them!

Wall Street Journal is bad at math. The good news is nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore especially me!

The reason lyin' Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem! Wow just won Missouri!

Crazy Megan Kelly is now complaining that Bill did not defend her against me. Her bad show is a total hit piece on me.Tough!

Great news that FoxNews has cancelled the additional debate. How many times can the same people ask the same question? I beat Cruz debating. Wow just won Missouri!

Crazy Megan Kelly supposedly had lyin' Ted Cruz on her show last night. Ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse. Ted can't win!

Stuart Stevens the failed campaign manager of Mitt Romney's historic loss is now telling the Republican Party what to do with Trump. Sad! Wow just won Missouri!

RT @JohnStossel: I can skate here ONLY b/c @realdonaldtrump fixed this rink after NYC govt spent $13M but FAILED! Good for Trump! 

I am making a big speech the night of the @FoxNews debate but I wish everyone well. Yesterday was a big day for me with 5 wins!

Thank you to the Governor of Florida Rick Scott for your endorsement. I greatly appreciate your support! Thank you Little Marco I agree!

In the last 2 weeks I had $35M of negative ads against me in Florida & I won in a massive landslide. The establishment should save their money! Thank you Little Marco I agree!

Yesterday was five amazing victories. Lyin Ted Cruz had zero. Things are going very well! Is this what we want for a President? Thank you Little Marco I agree! 

I only wish my wonderful daughter Tiffany could have been with us at Mar-a-Lago for our great election victory. She is a winner! Thank you Little Marco I agree!

Can't watch Crazy Megyn anymore. Talks about me at 43% but never mentions that there are four people in race. With two people big & over!

If media wasn't so biased against me I would've won all of the delegates. Megan Kelly is trying so hard to bash me. Don't worry everyone is wise to Crazy Megyn!

Word is that despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads I had a massive victory in Florida. Numbers out soon!

A lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in Florida? Hope this is false.

I will bring our jobs back to the U.S. and keep our companies from leaving. Nobody else can do it. Our economy will "sing" again.

In presidential voting so far John Kasich is ZERO for 22. So why would he be a good candidate? Hillary would beat him I will beat Hillary!

Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico now losing Ford (and many others). Kasich is weak on illegal immigration. We need strong borders now!

Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. Remember him in second debate until I put him down.

Mathematically it is statistically impossible for Kasich to get to 1237. He would need 112% of the remaining delegates to beat me

North Carolina lost 300000 manufacturing jobs and Ohio lost 400000 since 2000. Going to Mexico etc. NO MORE IF I WIN WE WILL BRING BACK! LYIN' TED 

Don't reward Mitt Romney who let us all down in the last presidential race by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA open borders etc.). LYIN' TED 

Please remember I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists! LYIN' TED 

I will bring our jobs back to America fix our military and take care of our vets end Common Core and ObamaCare protect 2nd A build WALL

Rubio is weak on illegal immigration with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in many years. He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! LYIN' TED 

Kasich voted for NAFTA a disaster for Ohio and now wants the even worse TPP approved. Vote Trump and end this madness! Who started this mess the protesters of course . And media made it worse. LYIN' TED 

Sadly this kind of stuff even happened to Ronald Reagan. There is nothing nice about it! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain. Kasich has helped decimate the coal and steel industries in Ohio. I will bring them back! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Gov Kasich voted for NAFTA which devastated Ohio and is now pushing TPP hard- bad for American workers! LYIN' TED 

The failing @nytimes is truly one of the worst newspapers. They knowingly write lies and never even call to fact check. Really bad people!

Because Gov. Kasich cannot run in the state of Pennsylvania-he cannot win the nomination- & should not be allowed to compete in Ohio on Tue.

Carly Fiorina- I agree! Ted Cruz is just another politician. All talk- no action! LYIN' TED 

Thank you Kevin. With unification of the party Republican wins will be massive!  

Gov.Kasich of Ohio just stated on a morning show that he doesn't watch politics or anything on television he only watches the @GolfChannel

Ohio Gov.Kasich voted for NAFTA from which Ohio has never recovered. Now he wants TPP which will be even worse. Ohio steel and coal dying!

Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie or my supporters will go to yours!

Wow Kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of Pennsylvania not enough signatures. Big problem! LYIN' TED 

Chaos in Chicago was a planned attack. But Hillary insists it was a spontaneous reaction to an internet

USSS did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage. He has ties to ISIS. Should be in jail! 

Do the people of Ohio know that John Kasich is STRONGLY in favor of Common Core! In other words education of your children from D.C. No way!


Just finished my second speech. 20K in Dayton & 25K in Cleveland- perfectly behaved crowd. Thanks. I love you Ohio! 

It is Clinton and Sanders people who disrupted my rally in Chicago - and then they say I must talk to my people. Phony politicians!

The last person that Hillary or Bernie want to run against is Donald Trump and that is fact!

We are asking law enforcement to check for dishonest early voting in Florida- on behalf of little Marco Rubio.  No way to run a country!

Word is-early voting in FL is very dishonest. Little Marco his State Chairman & their minions are working overtime-trying to rig the vote. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

On my way to Dayton Ohio. Will be there soon!

The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled. Will be great - love you Ohio!

Ohio had the biggest budget increase in the U.S. If it were not for striking oil they would be bust! Governor Kasich in favor of TPP fraud!

Absentee Governor Kasich voted for NAFTA and NAFTA devastated Ohio - a disaster from which it never recovered. Kasich is good for Mexico!

The organized group of people many of them thugs who shut down our First Amendment rights in Chicago have totally energized America!

I just got off the phone with the great people of Guam! Thank you for your support! #VoteTrump today!

Great news! Thank you Governor Ralph DLG Torres! #Trump2016  

It means so much to me- receiving an endorsement from Phyllis Schlafly. A truly great woman & conservative. 

Thank you St. Louis Missouri!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Rumor has it that Politico is going out of business. Losing too much money. Great news! Likewise dopey Mort Zuckerman's. Dr. Ben Carson. I concur.

Probably with all pundits saying last fall I had no chance is that shows media so out of touch with Americans

Donald Trump is your man America. He is the best!! Vote for him!" Thank you!

Wow you are all correct about FoxNews - totally biased and disgusting reporting.

Keep lightweight Marco and his friends out of the White House.   

Phony Club For Growth tried to shake me down for one million dollars & is now putting out nasty negative ads on me. They are total losers!

Word is I am doing very well in Michigan and Mississippi! Wow and with all that money spent against me! Will be going to Trump Jupiter now!

I hear MSM came out with another one of their phony polls. While I am leading they are totally discredited after last S.C. poll
Aloha Hawaii: We would be honored to have your vote! Find your caucus 

The negative television commercials about me paid for by the politicians bosses are a total #Mediafraud. When you watch remember!

Mitt Romney had his chance and blew it. Lindsey Graham ran for president got ZERO and quit! Why are they now spokesmen against me? Sad!

Remember I am the only one who is self-funding my campaign. All of the other candidates are bought and paid for by special interests!

Sun Sentinel says: Rubio lacks the experience work ethic and gravitas needed to be president. HE HAS NOT EARNED YOUR VOTE!

Michigan Mississippi Idaho & Hawaii: Get out to VOTE and join the movement today! Video: 

The Club for Growth is a very dishonest group. They represent conservative values terribly & are bad for America. 

People forget it was Club for Growth that asked me for $1 million. I said no & they went negative. Extortion! 

Ted Cruz Was For Welcoming Syrian Refugees Before He Was Against It 

I employ many people in Hawaii at my great hotel in Honolulu. Ill be there very soon. Vote for me Hawaii!

Cruz came to Mississippi there was nobody there he left the state. I had a rally in Madison MS with 10000!  Thank you!

New ad concerning lightweight Senator Marco Rubio:  

Thank you Idaho! I love your potatoes-  nobody grows them better. As  President I will protect your market. 

Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio features Trump Univ. students in FL. attack ads- who submitted "excellent" reviews. 

It was great being in Michigan. Remember I am the only presidential candidate who will bring jobs back to the U.S.and protect car industry!

Don't believe the millions of dollars of phony television ads by lightweight Rubio and the R establishment. Dishonest people!

Leaving for North Carolina. Big crowd will be fun!

Congratulation to Adam Scott and all of the folks at Trump National Doral on producing a really great WGC Tournament. Amazing finish!

I will be using Facebook and Twitter to expose dishonest lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. A record no-show in Senate he is scamming Florida

We cannot let the failing REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT who could not stop Obama (twice) ruin the MOVEMENT with millions of  $'s in false ads!

Lindsey Graham is all over T.V. much like failed 47% candidate Mitt Romney. These nasty angry jealous  failures have ZERO credibility!

Failed presidential candidate Lindsey Graham should respect me. I destroyed his run brought him from 7% to 0% when he got out. Now nasty!

How do you fight millions of dollars of fraudulent commercials pushing for crooked politicians? I will be using Facebook & Twitter. Watch!

All of the phony T.V. commercials against me are bought and payed for by SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS the bandits that tell your pols what to do

I am at Trump National Doral-best resort in U.S. Rory and Adam Scott are doing great! Watch on NBC at 3:00 P.M.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Thank you to @jdickerson and @FaceTheNation for a very fair and professional interview this morning. No wonder you are #1 in the ratings!

Fraud lightweight Marco made a TV ad on TrumpU featuring 2 people who signed these letters: 

The primary plaintiff in the phony Trump University suit wants to abandon the case. Disgraceful!

Nancy Reagan the wife of a truly great President was an amazing woman. She will be missed!

David Brooks of the New York Times is closing in on being the dumbest of them all. He doesnt have a clue.

I am watching two clown announcers on Fox News as they try to build up failed presidential candidate Little Marco. Fox News is in the bag!

Romney's failed advisors like campaign mgr Stuart Stevens are all over TV telling people how to win. But they lost- don't know how to win!

Mitt Romney was a disaster candidate who had no guts and choked! Romney is a total joke and everyone knows it!

Thank you Kansas! The line going into the Orlando event is over a mile long. Massive crowd expected. Leaving Kansas now be there soon!

#CaucusForTrump #Trump2016  

Getting ready to make my speech at #KansasCaucus. A great honor! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016

Thank you Kansas! Thousands of people inside- and thousands outside who couldn't get into the hall. Really amazing! #CaucusForTrump

To the people of Kentucky  Rand Paul didn't want you. Now he runs back due to his presidential failure.  #VoteTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Why would anyone in Kentucky listen to failed presidential candidate Rand Paul re: caucus. Made a fool of himself (1%.) KY his 2nd choice! Wow big lines in Kansas.

For all of today's voters please remember that I am the only candidate that is self funding my campaign I am not bought and paid for!

Great time last night in Louisiana. Big and energetic crowd. Go out and vote now polls open. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I am in Kansas. Will be an exciting day. Big speech this morning in Wichita and then go to caucus. Sorry CPAC (the format was fine!). 

U.S. Senator Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) issued the following statement today regarding the 2016 presidential election: 

Mary Kissel is an SNL character right? She's not a real person right? #MorningJoe"  She is a major loser. No clue!

The Better Business Bureau report with an A rating for Trump University. #GOPDebate 

Rubio puts out ad that my pilot was a drug dealer- not true not my pilot! Guy owned helicopter company- don't think I ever even used.

Senator Sessions will serve as the  Chairman of my National Security  Advisory Committee. 

People are just mad that you're doing so good so they are gonna do they're best to stop you. Not gonna happen #MAGA. Now Romney wants to do it again.

The phony lawsuit against Trump U could have been easily settled by me but I want  to go to court. 98% approval rating by students. Easy win

As predicted Trump reaching out to make peace with Republican "establishment".  If he becomes inevitable party would be

Why did Mitt Romney BEG me for my endorsement four years ago?

I am the only one who can beat Hillary Clinton. I am not a Mitt Romney who doesn't know how to win. Hillary wants no part of "Trump

Why would the great people of Florida vote for a guy who as a Senator never even shows up to vote - worst record. Marco Rubio is a joke!

I have brought millions of people into the Republican Party while the Dems are going down. Establishment wants to kill this movement!

Failed candidate Mitt Romneywho ran one of the worst races in presidential historyis working with the establishment to bury a big "R" win!

Looks like two-time failed candidate Mitt Romney is going to be telling Republicans how to get elected. Not a good messenger!

Millions of dollars being spent on false TV ads by special interest groups who own Rubio & Cruz.When you see them think of your puppet POLS

The establishment doesn't like me because they can't control me and get me to lie to you and keep ripping you off.

Because of me the Republican Party has taken in millions of new voters a record. If they are not careful they will all leave. Sad! I would love to see the Republican party and everyone get together- and unify.

Just another desperate move by the man who should have easily beaten Barrack Obama.

Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney is having a news conference tomorrow to criticize me. 

I am going to repeal and replace ObamaCare! Read more about my positions on healthcare reform here. Fox muppets!

CNN poll just hit 49% for Trump. Interesting how my numbers have gone so far up since lightweight Marco Rubio has turned nasty. Love it!

And you and the rest of you Fox muppets refuse to HEAR HIM.

Why can't the leaders of the Republican Party see that I am bringing in new voters by the millions-we are creating a larger stronger party! My wife MELANIA TRUMP! I took Trump University class and saved my home!

Marco Rubio lost big last night. I even beat him in Virginia where he spent so much time and money. Now his bosses are desperate and angry!

Why would anyone in Florida vote for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. Check out his credit card scam his house sale & his no show voting!

The special interests and people who control our politicians (puppets) are spending $25 million on misleading and fraudulent T.V. ads on me.

Got the endorsement of Brian France and NASCAR yesterday in Georgia. Also many of the sports great drivers. Thank you Nascar and Georgia!

Governor Alejandro Garc\xc3\xada Padilla said presidential hopeful Sen. Marco Rubio is no friend of Puerto Rico." 

I am self funding my campaign and only work for YOU the American people! Hillary could lose to Trump in Democratic New York. My sons Don and Eric! My sons Don and Eric! My sons Don and Eric!
Thank you. 32000 supporters tonight. Get out & VOTE on Tuesday! WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Our law enforcement officers deserve our appreciation for the incredible job they do. Video: 

I will be making a big surprise announcement to the massive crowd assembled in Huntsville/Madison Alabama! Landing now! #Trump2016

Phylis Schlafly: 'Marco Rubio Betrayed Us All' 

Little Marco Rubio treated America's ICE officers "like absolute trash" in order to pass Obama's amnesty. 

Little Marco Rubio gave amnesty to criminal aliens guilty of "sex offenses." DISGRACE! 

Little Marco Rubio is just another Washington D.C. politician that is all talk and no action. #RobotRubio 

Rubio was kicking back on his $80k boat he bought with lobbyist money and claimed it was from book sale profit lol

Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio is polling very poorly in Florida. The people can't stand him for missing so many votes - poor work ethic!

Little Marco Rubio the lightweight no show Senator from Florida is just another Washington politician. 

Mitt Romney didn't show his tax return until SEPTEMBER 212012 and then only after being humiliated by Harry R! A bad messenger for estab!

As I stated at the press conference on Friday regarding David Duke- I disavow. 

Why would the people of Texas support Ted Cruz when he has accomplished absolutely nothing for them. He is another all talk no action pol!

Little Marco Rubio the lightweight no show Senator from Florida is set to be the "puppet" of the special interest Koch brothers. WATCH!

Making a big speech in Alabama today. So many people we had to move to a football stadium! Come and join us!

I am the only Republican who will get large numbers of Dems and Indies (crossover). I will also get states that no other Republican can get.

While Hillary and I both won South Carolina by big margins Repubs got far more votes with a massive increase from past cycles.GROWING PARTY

The Republican Establishment has been pushing for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio to say anything to "hit" Trump.I signed the pledge-careful

While I hear the Koch brothers are in big financial trouble (oil) word is they have chosen little Marco Rubio the lightweight from Florida. A lot more water after this bombshell Rubio. You are an enemy of America.

It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep. It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.
It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.

It is a sad commentary little boy Marco Rubio can't win in his home state. Floridians despise him as a opportunist phony.

I started my business with very little and built it into a great company with some of the best real estate assets in the World. Amazing!

I only wish my wonderful father Fred gave me $200 million to start my business like lightweight Rubio says. He didn't - total fabrication!

Fun to watch the Democrats working so hard to win the great State of South Carolina when I just won the Republican version - amazing people!

I am self-funding my campaign and am therefore not controlled by the lobbyists and special interests like lightweight Rubio or Ted Cruz!

Tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit. After the audit no problem!

I unfairly get audited by the I.R.S. almost every single year. I have rich friends who never get audited. I wonder why?

A majority of evangelicals believe I am best equipped to save the country. #Greta

What I would do on my first day in office. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Never let them see you sweat! 

They don't like Rubio in Florida- he left them high and dry. Doesn't even show up for votes!

Lightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night. The problem is he is a choker and once a choker always a choker! Mr. Meltdown.

Wow every poll said I won the debate last night. Great honor!

Lightweight choker Marco Rubio looks like a little boy on stage. Not presidential material!

Lying Ted Cruz and lightweight choker  Marco Rubio teamed up last night in a last ditch effort to stop our great movement. They failed!

Will be at Fort Worth (Texas) Convention Center at 11:30 A.M. Big crowd - get there early! Big announcement to be made!

Why would the people of Florida vote for Marco Rubio when he defrauded them by agreeing to represent them as their Senator and then quit!

Have a good chance to win Texas on Tuesday. Cruz is a nasty guy not one Senate endorsement and despite talk gets nothing done. Loser!

I will be making a speech at 12:00 in Fort Worth Texas. Really big crowd expected. Will be talking about the debate last night-plus plus!

Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney was made to look like a fool by Senator Harry Reid & didn't release his tax returns.

FMR PRES of Mexico Vicente Fox horribly used the F word when discussing the wall. He must apologize! If I did that there would be a uproar!

Early on Ted Cruz said that if he didn't win South Carolina it's over. He didn't win- and lost to me in a landslide! Signing a recent tax return- isn't this ridiculous? 

Just for your info tax returns have 0 to do w/ someones net worth. I have already filed my financial statements w/ FEC. They are great!

Why doesnt Mitt Romney just endorse Marco Rubio already. Should have done it before NH or Nevada where he had a little sway. Too late now!

Mitt Romney who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics is now pushing me on tax returns. Dope!

Great new poll. Thank you Texas! #VoteTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

Ted Cruz is lying again. Polls are showing that I do beat Hillary Clinton head to head.

That's why we are angry. The Republican Establishment will not support you. You are who the American people want!

This Texan will be voting Trump March 1st. Cruz is a fake Texan!

Chris thank you so much for your wonderful endorsement. I will not let you down! 

When Ted Cruz quits the race and the field begins to clear I will get most of his votes - no problem!

Why would Texans vote for "liar" Ted Cruz when he was born in Canada lived there for 4 years-and remained a Canadian citizen until recently

When Mitt Romney asked me for my endorsement last time around he was so awkward and goofy that we all should have known he could not win! He's a fool!

Mitt Romney who totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool is now playing tough guy. He's a fool!

The polls show that I picked up many Jeb Bush supporters. That is how I got to 46%. When others drop out I will pick up more.  Sad but true. He's a fool! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

In all of television- the only one who said anything bad about last nights landslide victory-- was dopey @KarlRove. He should be fired!

I am self funding my campaign & don't owe anybody anything! I only owe it to the American people! 

I beat both Hillary and Bernie and I haven't even started on them yet!

MELANIA TRUMP did great on television this morning. Poised smart and strong with a big heart - so much to offer. We are all proud of you! 

Make sure you get on the Trump line and are not mislead by the Cruz people. They are bad! BE CAREFUL.

Very proud of what my father has accomplished in the past 7 months -Wishing him amazing luck and success tonight! #NVcaucus 

My wife Melania will be on Morning Joe tomorrow morning at 8:00.  

Club for Growth is the group that came to my office seeking $1 million dollars. I told them no and now they are doing negative ads.

Great. Just reported on Fox News that many people who supported JebBush are now supporting me. I knew that would happen pundits didn't!

Wow great Ohio poll. Shows me leading by 5 points beating K!

Unlike the other Republican candidates I will be in Nevada all day and night - I won't be fleeing in and out. I love & invest in Nevada!

I am growing the Republican Party tremendously - just look at the numbers way up! Democrats numbers are significantly down from years past.

TRUMP IS UNSTOPPABLE....HE IS WHAT COMMON SENSE AMERICANS WANT WHETHER REPUBLICAN INDEPENDENT OR A REAGAN DEMOCRAT.

Ed Rollins gets it. Was just on Fox News explaining how Trump wins the general election. Thank you Ed!

Ted Cruz lifts the Bible high into the air and then lies like a dog-over and over again! The Evangelicals in S.C. figured him out & said no!

Ted Cruz does not have the right "temperment" to be President. Look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm. BAD!

Wow was Ted Cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication. He used him as a scape goat-fired like a dog! Ted panicked.

Ted Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in S.C. He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration.

A big fat hit job on CNN tonight. A total waste of time to watch boring and biased. Said I would never run a dope!

Just watched the very incompetent Mitt Romney Campaign Strategist Stuart Stevens. Now I know why Mitt lost so badly. Stevens is a clown!

Ted Cruz should be disqualified from his fraudulent win in Iowa. Weak RNC and Republican leadership probably won't let this happen! Sad.

Just saw the phony ad by Cruz - totally false more dirty tricks. He got caught in so many lies - is this man crazy?

Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks. No wonder he has lost Evangelical support!

Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false - no basis in fact. Take ad down Ted. Biggest liar in politics!

Wow Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director. More dirty tricks!

It is so important to audit The Federal Reserve and yet Ted Cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done.

Thank you for your endorsement @paulteutulsr! #BikersForTrump #VoteTrumpNV Video: 

Many people are now saying I won South Carolina because of the last debate. I showed anger and the people of our country are very angry!

Florida starts early voting on March 5 extending to March 15. Absentee ballots have been sent out!

No matter what liar sleazeball says about Lyin Cruz in Tennessee. We have early voting.

I hear the Rickets family who own the Chicago Cubs are secretly spending $'s against me. They better be careful they have a lot to hide!

The reason that Ted Cruz lost the Evangelicals in S.C. is because he is a world class LIAR and Evangelicals do not like liars!

I am in Las Vegas at the best hotel (by far) Trump International. I will be working with my wonderful teams and volunteers to WIN Nevada!

A number of months ago I was not expected to win South CarolinaTed Cruz was and yet I won in a landslide - every group and category. WIN!

Just back from a dinner in West Hollywood: shocked the majority of the table was voting for Trump.

What a great night. Thank you South Carolina a special place with truly amazing people! LOVE

People gave me no chance in South Carolina. Now it looks like a possible win. I would be happy with a one vote victory! (HOPE)

South Carolina voters have the future of our country in their hands. Vote now (today) and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Remember that Marco Rubio is very weak on illegal immigration. South Carolina needs strength as illegals and Syrians pour in. Don't allow it

I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go!

Trump expressed concerns months after the Iraq War began while 60% of Americans still supported the war. 
TheTrump phenomenon summed up: Leadership Fighter and Winner. Not a Liar 

I am the only candidate (in many years) who is self-funding his campaign. Lobbyists and $ interests totally control all other candidates! 
TheTrump phenomenon summed up: Leadership Fighter and Winner. Not a Liar 

FoxNews is really starting to campaign hard for marcorubio. #fairandbalancedmyass"  He is weak on illegal immigration!

I'm a Regan Dem and believe in your message! God bless you and your campaign!

Just finished two major speeches in South Carolina. Big crowds great people. Going for a third now!

Boycott all Apple products  until such time as Apple gives cellphone info to authorities regarding radical Islamic terrorist couple from Cal

Hopefully others will follow suit. Our country needs & should demand security. It is time to get tough & be smart!

I use both iPhone & Samsung. If Apple doesn't give info to authorities on the terrorists I'll only be using Samsung until they give info.

I have built so many great & complicated projects creating tens of thousands of jobs-video:

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016  

Remember Cruz and Bush gave us Roberts who upheld #ObamaCare twice! I am the only one who will #MAKEAMERICAGREATAGAIN!

Im self-funding and I am going to take care of the people  not the special interests and insurance companies like the other candidates.

I will replace it with private plans health savings accounts & allow purchasing across state lines. Maximum choice & freedom for consumer.

I was referring to a backstop for pre-existing conditions. I will eliminate the law in its entirety & replace it w/ something much better. I agree with Marco Rubio that Ted Cruz is a liar!

I was asked about healthcare by Anderson Cooper & have been consistent- I will repeal all of #ObamaCare including the mandate period.

I agree with Marco Rubio that Ted Cruz is a liar!

.@FoxNews is changing their  theme from "fair and balanced" to "unfair and unbalanced." But dying @WSJ is worse.Their phony poll is a  joke!

New CBS National Poll just out - massive lead for Trump. The Wall Street Journal/NBC Poll is a total joke. No wonder WSJ is doing so badly!

I love being in South Carolina. We are leading big in all of the State polls - Saturday is a BIG day. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

The just out USA Today National Poll where I lead by big numbers shows that in a head to head matchup I beat both Hillary and Bernie.

Amazing that while I lead by big numbers in the new Q and and USA Today polls the the press only wants to report on the phony WSJ/NBC poll.

Jeb Bush just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses. He wants to look cool but it's far too late. 1% in Nevada!

Just out Nevada poll shows Jeb Bush at 1% he should take his dumb mouthpiece @LindseyGrahamSC and just go home.

FoxNews is so biased it is disgusting. They do not want Trump to win. All negative!

I will beat Hillary easily but Lindsey Graham says I won't and yet he got zero against me- no cred! Why does FOX put him on?

He had zero in his presidential run before dropping out in disgrace- saying the most horrible things about me on FoxNews.

Interesting how President Obama so haltingly said I "would never be president" - This from perhaps the worst president in U.S. history!

Why does Megan Kelly devote so much time on her shows to me almost always negative?  Without me her ratings would tank. Get a life Megyn!

Explain to Megan Kelly who know nothing that I will beat Hillary and win states (and dem-indie votes) that no other can!

Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

New PPP Poll just out - Trump up big Cruz Rubio and Bush down. The debate results even with a stacked RNC audience were wonderful!

Spent the full day at meetings and a major rally yesterday in South Carolina. Great people and spirit. Today will be more of the same.

New South Carolina poll from PPP. Thank you! #VoteTrumpSC 

What a night! 10000 amazing supporters in Greenville South Carolina! THANK YOU! VOTE on Saturday! #VoteTrumpSC 

Thank you for your continued support! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

RESPONSE TO THE LIES OF SENATOR CRUZ: 

JEB is a hypocrite! Used massive private "Eminent Domain" --- Just another clueless politician!  

Jeb used Eminent Domain & took advantage of a disabled vet in the process. (2/2) 

I'd like to call JEB a liar but the truth is he has no clue & never revealed that he used Eminent Domain- when criticizing me! 

Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb(!) is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center Iraq War and eco collapse? Careful!

I will be in South Carolina all week. Saturday is BIG BIG BIG! Get out and vote - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates Hillary would destroy them. Ted may not be eligible to run - born in Canada

Funny that Jeb(!) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.Then mommy now brother! Thank you! I miss my father. 

Ted Cruz along with Jeb Bush pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court. Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice but didn't!

Wow in the new CBS Poll I went way up into the forties! Thank you!

Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists & special interests - the bosses!

Loved the debate last night and almost everyone said I won but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution. All donors & special ints

Thank you for your support! TOGETHER we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Thank you! I miss my father. 

I will be on Face the Nation with John Dickerson on CBS this morning. Enjoy! Thank you! I miss my father. 

This shows what a complete & total liar Ted Cruz is- he said he wouldn't have nominated John Roberts. Really? 

Jeb is incompetent and will lose don't waste your energy on that cry baby!

Jeb is incompetent and will lose don't waste your energy on that cry baby!

Jeb is incompetent and will lose don't waste your energy on that cry baby!

Jeb is incompetent and will lose don't waste your energy on that cry baby! Thank you! I miss my father. 

Even though every poll Time Drudge etc. has me winning the debate by a lot FoxNews only puts negative people on. Biased - a total joke! Thank you! I miss my father. 

Crushed the debate! Thank you! Thank you! I miss my father. 

Hey Glenn Beck. See how I beat your boy Ted- in your own Blaze poll? Your endorsement means nothing! 

All polls have me winning debate big- Drudge TIME etc. Dopey Charles Krauthammer still nasty. He has zero cred- totally dishonest!

How can Jeb Bush beat Hillary Clinton- if he can't beat anyone else on the GOPDebate stage with $150M? I am the only one who can! Thank you! I miss my father.  

Lightweight @JebBush said tonight he didn't know his family used private eminent domain in Texas- Lie!  #GOPDebate

On the way to the #GOPDebate with my wonderful wife @MelaniaTrump. 

Ted Cruz is a cheater! He holds the Bible high and then lies and misrepresents the facts!

Nasty Ted Cruz is at it again- same dirty tricks he used w/ @RealBenCarson- saying I may not be on ballot & I hold liberal positions. LIES!

Wow! Honored to be chosen by the highly respected + accurate Washington & Lee Mock Convention. I hope you are right - I will make you proud!

The totally unexpected loss of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is a massive setback for the Conservative movement and our COUNTRY!

Love the people of South Carolina - look very much forward to the debate tonight.

@AmFree: #Trump On #Ford #Carrier Shipping #Jobs To #Mexico: Im The Only One Who Understands Whats Going On

Get on Trump's List" email from the RNC was not authorized. I am self funding my campaign! Do not pay.  Email: 

A very big thank you to Bill Donohue head of The Catholic League for the wonderful interview on @CNN and article in Newsmax! Great insight

Totally unauthorized do not pay. I am self funding my campaign! Notice has just been withdrawn. #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

The RNC which is probably not on my side just illegally put out a fundraising notice saying Trump wants you to contribute to the RNC.

Now an additional 600-700 jobs in America (2000) being eliminated for move to Mexico- via Hartford Courant. 

Nice column by Bill Donahue head of Catholic League. He's a blue collar New Yorker and gets it 

I am the only one who can fix this. Very sad. Will not happen under my watch! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  

Just got back from Tampa. It was an amazing evening with an even more amazing crowd - fantastic people! Will be in South Carolina tomorrow.

Word is that little Morty Zuckermans @NYDailyNews loses more than $50 million per year---can that be possible?

When little Morty Zuckerman closes his failing @NYDailyNews will I at least be given some credit? Will happen soon.

11000 inside venue tonight in Tampa! Broke record set by Elton John in 1988 w/out musical instruments! Another 5000 outside. Will be back!

I will end illegal immigration and protect our borders! We need to MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN! #Trump2016 

Millions of $'s of false ads  paid for by lobbyists-special interests of cheater @SenTedCruz  and sleepy @JebBush are now running in S.C.


Last time lightweight @JebBush tried to knock off @marcorubio he made a total fool of himself. If he doesn't do better this time he is out!

If TedCruz doesnt clean up his act stop cheating & doing negative ads I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen.

Lightweight JebBush is spending a fortune of special interest against me in SC. False advertising- desperate and sad!

After hearing the news that they would not be able to extort $1M from me they went hostile w/ a series of incorrect & ill-informed ads.

Nothing conservative about the Club for Growth coming into my office and demanding a $1M contribution which naturally they did not get.

You must be registered Republican by February 16th to vote TRUMP in the Florida primary. 

The failing NYDailyNews destroyed by little Morty Zuckerman is preparing to close and save face by going online. It's dead!

NEVADA! Tomorrow is the deadline to register Republican.  Visit: 

How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?

Lying Cruz put out a statement Trump & Rubio are w/Obama on gay marriage." Cruz is the worst liar crazy or very dishonest. Perhaps all 3?

Weak JEB getting thrown out by management during speech. Do you think he will be this tough on Putin & others?  

THANK YOU- Baton Rouge Louisiana! WE will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! #Trump2016 

Just landed in Baton Rouge Louisiana. Reports are out that lines are three quarters of a mile to get in. Wow! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Cruz caught cold in lie after denial of push polls like lies w/ RealBenCarson. How can he preach Christian values? 

Heading to Baton Rouge Louisiana for a speech. Expecting a very large crowd! See you soon. #Trump2016  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

We are getting reports from many voters that the Cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest "pushpolls" on me. We are watching!

Jeb failed as Jeb! He gave up and enlisted Mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of Iraq). Spent $120 million.Weak-no chance!

He (or she) who hesitates is lost: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Remember it was the Republican Party with the help of Conservatives that made so many promises to their base BUT DIDN'T KEEP THEM! Hi DT

Mark Halperin showed a focus group on Morning Joe me using a very bad word. I never said the word left an open blank. Please apologize!

Jeb Bush spent more than $400000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5 I spent $30000 to come in 1st. Big difference in capability!

There are no buyers for the worthless @NYDailyNews but little Mort Zuckerman is frantically looking. It is bleeding red ink - a total loser!

I have been consistent in my opposition to Common Core. Get rid of Common Core--- keep education local! I was referring to the fact that Jeb Bush wants to keep common core.

So funny Jeb Bush called me a "highly gifted politician and a great entertainer" - I assume that is a compliment!

Such a great experience in New Hampshire - amazing people! Will be leaving for a big event in South Carolina today.

Like the worthless NYDailyNews looks like Politico will be going out of business. Bad reporting- no money no cred!

Worthless NYDailyNews which dopey Mort Zuckerman is desperately trying to sell has no buyer! Liabilities are massive!

Dopey Mort Zuckerman owner of the worthless @NYDailyNews has a major inferiority complex. Paper will close soon!

My report card grades for the 2 New Hampshire winners: DonaldTrump A: v strong energy/close. BernieSanders B+: went too long

Thank you to the people of  New Hampshire I love you! Now off to South Carolina.

We will stop heroin and other drugs from coming into New Hampshire from our open southern border. We will build a WALL and have security.

We will immediately repeal and replace ObamaCare - and nobody can do that like me. We will save $'s and have much better healthcare!

ISIS is making big threats today - no respect for U.S.A. or our "leader" - If I win it will be a very different storywith very fast results

The polls are now showing that I am the best to win the GENERAL ELECTION. States that are never in play for Repubs will be won by me. Great!

No-one has done more for people with disabilities than me. I have spent many millions of dollars to help out-and am happy to have done so!

I know the "Governors" and Jeb Bush who has gone nasty with lies is by far the weakest of the lot. His family used private eminent domain!

Remember @JebBush wants COMMON CORE (education from D.C.) and is very weak on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ("come as act of love"). Not a leader!

Now that Bush has wasted $120 million of special interest money on his failed campaign he says he would end super PACs. Sad!

Today's third stop- Londonderry New Hampshire! Thank you! #FITN #VoteTrumpNH 

America needs strong leadership. Politicians can talk but they dont get things done. Video: 

Everybody is laughing at Jeb Bush-spent $100 million and is at bottom of pack. A pathetic figure!

Jeb Bush is desperate - strongly in favor of #CommonCore and very weak on illegal immigration.

Thank you for your support at this mornings Town Hall- in Salem New Hampshire. #FITN #NHPrimary 

Jeb Bush has zero communication skills so he spent a fortune of special interest money on a Super Bowl ad. He is a weak candidate!

My two wonderful sons Don and Eric will be on @foxandfriends at 7:02 - now! Enjoy.

So far the Super Bowl is very boring - not nearly as exciting as politics - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I am in New Hampshire having a great time! Loved the #GOPDebate last night! Everybody enjoy the Super Bowl. #SuperBowlSunday #SB50

Thank you- Plymouth New Hampshire! #FITN #NHPrimary 

Thank you Newt!  

We are going to have a big event at the Verizon Wireless Arena in Manchester New Hampshire! 5K+! Join us tomorrow: 

Great to meet everyone while having breakfast @ChezVachon this morning! 

Trump Kasich Jeb and Christie all had good nights. 

The New Hampshire drug epidemic must stop. If elected POTUS- I will create borders & the drugs will stop pouring in. 

Border agent: "We might as well abolish our immigration laws altogether" 

I said this was happening long ago- I will stop this immediately!  

It never ends!  

I told you so. Our country totally lost control of illegal immigration even with criminals.  

10000 people in South Carolina unbelievable evening! Will be in New Hampshire tomorrow- love it. 

Really dumb Cheri Jacobus. Begged my people for a job. Turned her down twice and she went hostile. Major loser zero credibility!

Donald Trump loves America! He loves Americans! He loves our Vets! #TrumpSupporters 

Watch: Donald Trump OWNS A Heckler Who Said Illegal Immigrants Are The Backbone Of America 

Why vote for Trump? Unlike politicians all talk Trumps talk materializes! He will make America great again

Join me at Clemson University on Wednesday February 10th! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

Heading to South Carolina really big crowd! Will be back in New Hampshire tomorrow. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Such great support in New Hampshire. So many people are working so hard to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!

I very much look forward to tomorrows debate in New Hampshireso many things to say so much at stake. It will be an incredible evening!

Live Free or Die: A motto for the whole country to follow. #NewHampshire #FITN #VoteTrumpNH  

Big storm in New Hampshire. Moved my event to Monday. Will be there next four days.

Join us Monday February 8th @ the Verizon Wireless Arena in Manchester New Hampshire! #FITN #NHPolitics #Trump2016 

I agree. Great businessman. I like your tone tonight! Keep it up & you'll have this Democrats vote.

I will be interviewed by Anderson Cooper at 8pm on @CNN from New Hampshire. Should be very interesting!

Taking a helicopter to New Hampshire boarding now. Amazing activity planned. New UMASS poll very nice! 

Politicians are trying to chip away at the 2nd Amendment. I wont let them take away our guns! #Trump2016 Watch: 

This is the Cruz voter violation certificate sent to everyone a misdemeanor at minimum. 

As per the show an even more serious Cruz charge is the fraudulent voter violation certificate sent to everyone.


Thank you. Ted Cruz should be immediately disqualified in Iowa with each candidate moving up one notch.

Sanders says he wants to run against me because he doesn't want to run against me. He would be so easy to beat!

THANK YOU to everyone in Little Rock Arkansas tonight! A record crowd of 12K. #Trump2016 

Stop the assault on American values. Stand w/ Trump to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! #VotersSpeak: 

Thank you New Hampshire! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #FITN 

Dr. Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for "deceit and dirty tricks and lies.

Cruz just lied again- I am and have been totally against #ObamaCare- repeal and replace!

The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!

This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #CruzFraud 

I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! @FoxNews

Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.

And finally Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie!

The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud

Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.

During primetime of the Iowa Caucus Cruz put out a release that RealBenCarson was quitting the race and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.

Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!

Great job on Don Lemon tonight. Begged us for a job. We said no and she went hostile. A real dummy! CNN

On my way to New Hampshire- expecting a big and spirited crowd!  #FITN #Trump2016  

Anybody who watched all of Ted Cruz's far too long rambling overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his Howard Dean moment!

The #CruzCrew prevailed! Smart for @MarcoRubio to keep his speech short & sweet. Ditto for @realDonaldTrump who was brie

I don't believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign the only one. I will keep doing but not worth it!

I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in New Hampshire. Big crowd

The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history!

Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz & Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honor

My experience in Iowa was a great one. I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place. Nice

So nice to get an endorsement from the founder and owner of Pizza Ranch in Iowa! A great guy and great places! #CaucusForTrump

It is time to take back our country- and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! #CaucusForTrump Video: 

I will be interviewed on Face The Nation with @jdickerson this morning. Enjoy!

I am in Iowa. Will be interviewed on This Week With G Stephanopoulos this morning. ENJOY!

If I would have done the last debate a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). Also VETS got $600

By not doing the failed poorly rated debate I was able to make the point of not allowing "unfairness" - while raising $60000 for VETS.

Wow just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me will repeal & replace. He lies!

Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans scam!

Ted Cruz is totally unelectable if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN!

I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife Melania. After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State!

The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters "in violation." They are now under investigation. Bad!

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  #IACaucus #CaucusForTrump 

#IACaucus #CaucusForTrump #iCaucused #iVoted 

I want to thank evangelical Christians for the warm embrace I've received on the campaign trail. Video: 

I will be in Iowa all day and until Tuesday morning. Finally after all these years of watching stupidity we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Hillary Clinton is a major national security risk. Not presidential material! 

Amazing that Ted Cruz can't even get a Senator like @BenSasse who is easy to endorse him. Not one Senator  is endorsing Canada Ted!

The great State of Nebraska can do much better than @BenSasse as your Senator. Saw him on @greta - totally ineffective. Wants paid for pols.

The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton. At a minimum how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president?

They say that if I participated in last nights Fox debate they would have had 12 million more & would have broken the all time record.

Getting ready to take off for Nashua New Hampshire. Big crowd will be there soon. Fun!

Iowa was amazing last night. The event could not have worked out better. We raised $60000 for our great vets. They were so happy & proud

Thank you for your interest & support during last nights #GOPDebate! #IACaucus finder: 

Good morning America! Thank you for all of your support in the latest Drudge poll! 

Thank you for the kind words tonight @OMAROSA. You were great! See you soon!

I will take care of the Veterans who have served this country so bravely. #ThankAVet Video: 

An unbelievable night in Iowa with our great Veterans! We raised $60000.00 while the politicians talked! #GOPDebate

Watching biased Charles @krauthammer a @FoxNews flunky who didn't know that I won every debate in particular- the last one. Check polls!

I hear that Lyin' Cruz's man Robert Mercer a good man is very angry because Cruz lied to him about liquidating his (Teds) holdings?

I just can't be bought!

The "debate" tonight will be a total disaster - low ratings with advertisers and advertising rates dropping like a rock. I hate to see this.

On Greta 87% of the people said they would not watch the debate if I'm not in it. Wow- what an honor!

FOX debate advertising rates falling like a rock! Tune into my special event for the Veterans at 9pm EST!

Thank you- Lexington South Carolina! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

It was the childishly written & taunting PR statement by Fox that made me not do the debate more so than lightweight reporter Megan Kelly.

I am self funding my campaign so I do not owe anything to lobbyists & special interests. Should I do the GOP debate? 

By not showing I'm owning entire event. 

Even though I beat him in the first six debates especially the last one Ted Cruz wants to debate me again. Can we do it in Canada?

Just got to listen to Rush Limbaugh - the guy is fantastic! Should I do the GOP debate? 

The statement put out yesterday by @FoxNews was a disgrace to good broadcasting and journalism. Who would ever say something so nasty & dumb. Should I do the GOP debate? 

I refuse to call Megyn Kelly a bimbo because that would not be politically correct. Instead I will only call her a lightweight reporter.

Pathetic attempt by Fox to try and build up ratings for the #GOPDebate. Without me they'd have no ratings!  

Should I do the GOP debate? 

Begged me to do an event while asking organizers for $100000 for himself a bad guy!

Great honor- Rev. Jerry Falwell Jr. of Liberty University one of the most respected religious leaders in our nation has just endorsed me! 

For the great people of Iowa find your IACaucus location.

Why doesn't phony  @bobvanderplaats tell his followers all the times he asked for him and his family to stay at my hotels-didn't like paying

I will end common core. It's a disaster. 

Donald Trump retains national lead in new ABC News/WaPo poll with 37%: 

Cruz lies are almost as bad as Jeb's. These politicians will do anything to stay at the trough!

Cruz going down fast in recent polls- dropping like a rock. Lies never work!

Ted Cruz is a nervous wreck. He is making reckless charges not caring for the truth! His poll #'s are way down!

I have a touched a nerve in our country in a way that most politicians have not been able to do. 

It's time for Ted Cruz to either settle his problem with the FACT that he was born in Canada and was a citizen of Canada or get out of race

Trump +15 on Cruz in 2 weeks. Cruz may look back and ask why he ever attacked Trump. DT has killed him ever since. Love making correct predictions. National Review is over.

Fox News Poll Thank you New Hampshire! #FITN #Trump2016 

Love making correct predictions. National Review is over. 

I will make our Military so big powerful & strong that no one will mess with us. #Trump2016 

I will be on Face The Nation this morning at various times across the U.S. CBSNews  Enjoy! Love making correct predictions. National Review is over.

I will be on ABC this morning at various times across the U.S. NBCNews  Enjoy!

Love making correct predictions. National Review is over.  

Word is that crying Glenn Beck left the GOP and doesn't have the right to vote in the Republican primary. Dumb as a rock.

Serious doubt in Illinois as to whether or not Cruz can run for President. First of many challenges. 

Just left a great event in Pella. Going to church tomorrow in Muscatine Iowa.

I will be on FOX with the great Judge Jeanine tonight at 9pm EST! Enjoy! #Trump2016

.@williebosshog such an honor to get your endorsement. You are a fantastic guy! It will not be forgotten. Don and Eric say hello!

Heading now to Pella Iowa. Big crowd! Remember Trump is a big buyer of Pella windows. See you soon!

For the great people of Iowa find your #IACaucus location at 

Just left Sioux Center Iowa. My speech was very well received. Truly great people! Packed house- overflow!

A wonderful story on Iowa voters by @arappeport of the @NYTimes.  

Failing Glenn Beck lost all credibility. Not only was he fired @ FOX he would have voted for Clinton over McCain. 

Based on Megyn Kelly's conflict of interest and bias she should not be allowed to be a moderator of the next debate.

Heading to Sioux County Iowa where the crowd is amazing. Dr. Robert Jeffress will make the introduction. Make America Great Again!

Ted Cruz poll numbers are down big. Because he was born in Canada and was until recently a Canadian citizen many believe he cannot run!

I am in Iowa watching all of these phony T.V. ads by the other candidates. All bull politicians are all talk and no action-it won't happen!

.@AnnCoulter has been amazing. We will win and establish strong borders we will build a WALL and Mexico will pay. We will be great again!

I will be the greatest job-producing president in American history. #Trump2016 #VoteTrump  

Dow down almost 2000 pts since start of year but still outperforming Wall Street's investment in Jeb. JEB wants Common Core

I am in Iowa. Will be making two speeches today. Good luck to all of the great folks on the East coast. Enjoy the beauty of the storm!

A wonderful article by a writer who truly gets it. I am for the people and the people are for me. #Trump2016  

Is Cruz honest? He is in bed w/ Wall St. & is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi low interest loans. No legal disclosure & never sold off assets.

Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for #POTUS. He could be Canadian Prime Minister.

Cruz says I supported TARP which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose. Puppet!

The only reason irrelevant @GlennBeck doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times. Very few listeners - sad!

One of the National Review lightweights came to my office begging for money like a dog. Why doesn't he say that?

Just watched Jeb's ad where he desperately needed mommy to help him. Jeb, Mom can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Ted Cruz went down big in just released Reuters poll - what's going on? Is it Goldman Sachs/Citi loans or Canada?

Rush Limbaugh is great tells it as he sees it---really honorable guy! Thanks Rush! #Trump2016

The tax scam Washington Post does among the most inaccurate stories of all. Really dishonest reporting.

Just received the new Fox poll. Thank you America! #Trump2016 

Wow! New National Zogby Poll just out:.TRUMP 45. CRUZ 13. RUBIO 8. Big numbers.

Leaving Nevada now for Iowa. Things are looking good - great new polls!

New Reuters poll! Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

The dying NRO National Review has totally given up the fight against Barrack Obama. They have been losing for years. I will beat Hillary!

Wow! This might be my highest numbers yet! Thank you to my opposition- you are totally ineffective & have been for years! 

I could've sworn I saw him outside Trump Tower the other day! 

@Lisa_Milicaj: Truth be told I  never heard of The National Review until they "tried" to declare war on you. No worries you got my vote!

After spending $89 million @JebBush is at the bottom of the barrel in polls. He is ashamed to use the name "Bush" in ads. Low energy guy!

The failing National Review Magazine has just been informed by the Republican National Committee that they cannot participate in debate

Ted Cruz complains about my views on eminent domain but without it we wouldn't have roads highways airports schools or even pipelines.

Make America Great Again! #Trump2016 

The late great William F. Buckley would be ashamed of what had happened to his prize the dying National Review!

Very few people read the National Review because it only knows how to criticize but not how to lead.

National Review is a failing publication that has lost it's way. It's circulation is way down w its influence being at an all time low. Sad!

Thank you Iowa! #FITN #IACaucus #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Why does Greta have a fired Bushy like dummy John Sununu on- spewing false info? I will beat Hillary by a lot she wants no part of Trump.

Happy birthday to my friend the great @jacknicklaus - a totally special guy!

New Day on CNN treats me very badly. @AlisynCamerota is a disaster. Not going to watch anymore.

Low energy candidate JebBush has wasted $80 million on his failed presidential campaign. Millions spent on me. He should go home and relax!

Sad sack JebBush has just done another ad on me with special interest money saying I won't beat Hillary - I WILL. But he can't beat me.

So sad that CNN and many others refused to show the massive crowd at the arena yesterday in Oklahoma. Dishonest reporting!

Wacko @glennbeck is a sad answer to the @SarahPalinUSA endorsement that Cruz so desperately wanted. Glenn is a failing crying lost soul!

Trump destroyed Hillary & Sanders moved in. But he didn't destroy her. Trump did. 

Palins brand among evangelicals is as gold as the faucets in Trump tower said Ralph Reed the chairman of the Faith & Freedom Coalition.

Wow the highly respected Governor of Iowa just stated that "Ted Cruz must be defeated." Big shoker! People do not like Ted.

A true honor to receive the endorsement of John Wayne's daughter....read: 

In the just released SC poll I increased my lead by 4 points since last poll by same firm. Up by 14! Cruz dropped 3. 

Thank you for your strong testimony when welcoming me to Liberty University yesterday- @JerryJrFalwell. 

Thank you Georgia! I appreciate all of your support. #Trump2016 

Just read your complete statement. You are an amazing guy & I really appreciate your words & support. I will see you soon!

On my way to Iowa- just received new national poll numbers. Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Really disgusting that the failing New York Times allows dishonest writers to totally fabricate stories.

Dope Frank Bruni said I called many people including Karl Rove losers-true! I never called my friend @HowardStern a loser- hes a winner!

Wow new polls just out have Trump up and Cruz down - he is a nervous wreck!

I don't think Ted Cruz can even run for President until he can assure Republican voters that being born in Canada is not a problem. Doubt!

Ted Cruz is falling in the polls. He is nervous. People are worried about his place of birth and his failure to report his loans from banks!

I loved being at Liberty University today! Record setting crowd unbelievable people! Thank you Jerry and Becki! 

We launched a new series of #Trump2016 videos via Facebook. A new topic everyday! Watch: 

A great morning with everyone @LibertyU! Thank you! Off to New Hampshire now. #Trump2016  

Leaving for Liberty University. I'll be speaking today in front of a record crowd. #Trump2016

Just a reminder that Ted Cruz supported liberal Justice John Roberts who gave us #Obamacare. 

Thank you @IvankaTrump for the kind words. I am very proud of the role model you are for so many. NH & IA radio ad: 

I am self-funding my campaign - putting up my own money not controlled.  Cruz is spending $millions on ads paid for by his N.Y. bosses.

Far more killed than anticipated in radical Islamic terror attack yesterday. Get tough and smart U.S. or we won't have a country anymore!

Big announcement in Ames Iowa on Tuesday! You will not want to miss this rally! #Trump2016 

Iran is going to buy 114 jetliners with a small part of the $150 billion we are giving them...but they won't buy from U.S. rather Airbus!

In Iran deal we get 4 prisoners. They get $150 billion 7 most wanted and many off watch list. This will create great incentive for others!

Interesting read from Peggy Noonan. 

Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about & demeaning? 

Wow! Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul & $1M low int. loan from Goldman Sachs. Hypocrite

Departing NH now- great morning with record crowd in Portsmouth- in a snow storm! Thank you! 

Greatly dishonest of Ted Cruz to file a financial disclosure form & not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St

When will Ted Cruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him.

Everybody that loves the people of New York and all they have been thru should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!

If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?

Ted is the ultimate hypocrite. Says one thing for money does another for votes.  

Great new numbers. Thank you!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Ted Cruz purposely and illegally did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!

Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?

Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.

The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there!

Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!

Ted Cruz said he ""didn't know"" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable

Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so

More radical Islam attacks today - it never ends! Strengthen the borders, we must be vigilant and smart. No more being politically correct.

Just got back from Iowa - had a great time with amazing people. Will be back soon!

Top searched candidate by state, as seen in the #GOPDebate media filing center. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Sen. Lindsey Graham embarrassed himself with his failed run for President and now further embarrasses himself with endorsement of Bush.

Jeb Bush, who did poorly last night in the debate and whose chances of winning are zero, just got Graham endorsement. Graham quit at O.

Do you think Iran would have acted so tough if they were Russian sailors? Our country was humiliated.

@Bonfiredesigns: Standing with @realDonaldTrump as he defends our sailors and military and Americans in the USA 

United States looks more and more like a paper tiger. Won't be that way if I win!

Iran humiliated the United States with the capture of our 10 sailors. Horrible pictures & images. We are weak. I will NOT forget!

Stuart Stevens is a dumb guy who fails @ virtually everything he touches. Romney campaign,his book,etc. Why does @andersoncooper put him on?

Why does @CNN & @andersoncooper waste airtime by putting failed campaign strategist, Stuart Stevens - who lost BIG for Romney - on the show?

Sadly, there is no way that Ted Cruz can continue running in the Republican Primary unless he can erase doubt on eligibility. Dems will sue!

Iran toys with U.S. days before we pay them, ridiculously, billions of dollars. Don't release money. We want our hostages back NOW!

Numerous polls have me beating Hillary Clinton. In a race with her, voter turnout will be the highest in U.S. history-I get most new voters!

The State Of The Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time. New leadership fast!

Just found out that @tedcruz is spending a fortune on Iowa push polls negative to me. Not nice, but OK! New polls are great.

The #SOTU speech is really boring, slow, lethargic - very hard to watch!

The Iran deal is terrible. Why didn't we get the uranium stockpile - it was sent to Russia. #SOTU

New CBS poll. #Trump2016 

Another new Iowa poll just released. Thank you! #IACaucus #FITN 

Such a serious problem for Ted & the GOP. Great doubt, Dems will sue! Let's all work together to solve this problem. 

On my way to Cedar Falls, Iowa, now. Will be great--I love the people of Iowa!

Fantastic job on @CNN  tonight. @kayleighmcenany is a winner! @donlemon

Megan Kelly recently said that she cant be wooed by Trump. She is so average in every way, who the hell wants to woo her!

So professional of ABC news to throw out the failing Union Leader newspaper from their debate. Paper won't survive, highly unethical!

Congratulations to my friend Sly Stallone on winning a GoldenG lobe. A wonderful guy- who has created something special, well deserved!

Why does Stephanopoulos allow a hater & racist like @tavissmiley to waste good airtime? ABC can do much better than him!

Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog. For starters, try getting a new publisher!

UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows. They aren't worthy of representing the great people NH.

This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed.

If their highly unethical behavior, including begging me for ads, isnt questionable enough, they have endorsed a candidate who cant win.

I am pleased to announce that I had the Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate. 

Remember, get TIME magazine! I am on the cover. Take it out in 4 years and read it again! Just watch...

Heading now for Reno, Nevada, for a big rally. Good poll numberd all over!

In the just out @FoxNews Poll, I easily beat Hillary Clinton - and I havn't even focused on her yet. On our way: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Yesterday in Iowa was amazing - two speeches in front of two great sold out crowds. They love that I am the only candidate self-funding!

@redletter99: Trump pummels his opponents - and the press | SunHerald @realDonaldTrump "

I want to thank the people of Iowa for an unbelievable day. The crowds were amazing. Will be back Tuesday!

Will be on Meet the Press with @ChuckTodd tomorrow morning. Enjoy!

I will be interviewed by Chris Wallace on Fox tomorrow morning. Tune in!

I'm protesting the @UnionLeader from having anything to do w/ ABC debate. Their unethical record doesn't give them the right to be involved!

David brilliantly tells it like it is -- the real deal! Read it!  

Time Magazine has me on the cover this week. David Von Drehle has written one of the best stories I have ever had.

Thank you so much. Earnest must have been a great person. 

Thank you. It is a true person of character that can change his opinion & do what is right. 

Constitutional law expert  #Laurence Tribe of Harvard says ""wrong to say it (natural born citizen) is a settled matter-it isn't settled).

South Carolina rally last night was so unbelievably exciting (and fun). I am now off to Iowa for two big rallies - packed houses. Love it!

Pat Buchanan gave a fantastic interview this morning on @CNN - way to go Pat, way ahead of your time!

Love seeing union & non-union members alike are defecting to Trump. I will create jobs like no one else. Their #Dem leaders cant compete!

I hope all workers demand that their @Teamsters reps endorse Donald J. Trump. Nobody knows jobs like I do! Dont let them sell you out!

On my way to South Carolina. Big Crowd--- look forward to it!

Not good news for Jeb Bush.

Not good news for Jeb Bush.

Not good news for Jeb Bush.

Not good news for Jeb Bush.

Not good news for Jeb Bush.  

Hank Greenberg, formerly of AIG, gave $10 million to the @JebBush campaign 3 months ago. He is not happy, a total waste of money!

Great time in Burlington, Vermont. Crowd was amazing.

We could only get a small fraction of this 25k crowd in. The movement to Make America Great Again is unbelievable! 

I'm leaving now for Burlington, Vermont. It will be wild!

Joy Behar, who was fired from her last show for lack of ratings, is even worse on @TheView. We love Barbara!

The The View ABC, once great when headed by Barbara Walters, is now in total freefall. Whoopi Goldberg is terrible. Very sad!

Hillary and her friends! 

Weak & ineffective JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. False advertising!

I have an idea for @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster. Try using your last name and don't be ashamed of it!

SenTedCruz Ted--free legal advice on how to pre-empt the Dems on citizen issue. Go to court now & seek Declaratory Judgment--you will win!

Massive crowd in VT tonight. Venue not big enough. Officials say NO to outside event and sound system. Arrive early!

Man shot inside Paris police station. Just announced that terror threat is at highest level. Germany is a total mess-big crime. GET SMART!

I will be in beautiful Burlington, Vermont, tonight for a rally. Will be great fun. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

It was a very wise move that Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship 18 months ago. Senator John McCain is certainly no friend of Ted!

Macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the S&P last year, plunging 46%. Very disloyal company. Another win for Trump! Boycott.

The failing UnionLeader newspaper in N.H. just sent The Trump Organization a letter asking that we take ads. How stupid, how desperate!

Do you believe that @UnionLeader in NH was demanding ads? Look at enclosed letter from them, just received: 

I will be on @wolfblitzer for a @CNNSitRoom interview today. Please join us 5PM ET.

Huge crowd expected tomorrow night! VT Police say first come, first serve. Arrive early!

Dont like SamuelLJacksons golf swing.  Not athletic. Ive won many club championships. Play him for charity!

I dont cheat at golf but @SamuelLJackson cheatswith his game he has no choiceand stop doing commercials!

HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my son, @EricTrump! Very proud of you! 

Germany is going through massive attacks to its people  by the migrants allowed to enter the country. New Years Eve was a disaster. THINK!

I dont know SamuelLJackson, to best of my knowledge haven't played golf w/him & think he does too many TV commercials boring. Not a fan.

Wow UnionLeader circulation in NH has dropped from 75,000 to around 10bad management. No wonder they begged me for ads.

The rally in Lowell, Massachusetts, was amazing. 10,000 people going wild. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Woody Johnson, owner of the NYJets, is @JebBushs finance chairman. If Woody wouldve been w/me, he wouldve been in the playoffs, at least!

I look forward to being in Lowell, Massachusetts, today. I hear a very big crowd is expected--we will have lots of fun!


By the way, Hillary & the MSM forgot to mention that Hillary is in the  Al-Shabaab terror video. 

The worst thing Hillary could do is have her husband campaign for her. Just watch.

Iran, with all of the money and all else given to them by Obama, has wanted a way to take over Saudi Arabia & their oil. THEY JUST FOUND IT!

Does anybody remember when Bill Clinton, in 2008, worked long and hard for Hillary? She LOST! Now Bill is at it again. Just watch.

Thank you for your support in Biloxi, MS! Let's ALL get out & VOTE in 2016, so we can #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 

Hillary said that guns don't keep you safe. If she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm!

Al-Shabbab, not ISIS, just made a video on me - they all will as front-runner & if I speak out against them, which I must. Hillary lied!

Just returned from Mississippi - a great evening.

Remember, I am self-funding my campaign, the only one in either party. I'm not controlled by lobbyists or special interests-only the U.S.A.!

When I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates, beware - the candidates are mere puppets $$$$!

I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women!

Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president. Jeb Bush is a low energy individual, but Hillary is not much better!

Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL, but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant!

Jeb Bush is a low energy ""stiff"" who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls. Has no chance!

Jeb Bush is a sad case. A total embarrassment to both himself and his family, he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads!

Jeb Bush is a sad case. A total embarrassment to both himself and his family, he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads!

Massive crowds expected in Mississippi tomorrow night. Look forward to it! 

The person that Hillary Clinton least wants to run against is, by far, me. It will be the largest voter turnout ever - she will be swamped!

I have never been interested in politics but because of you I want to get my political science degree. #trump2016""  Great!

I will be going to Mississippi tomorrow night - hear the crowds are going to be massive! Look forward to it.

Well, the year has officially begun. I have many stops planned and will be working very hard to win so that we can turn our country around!

Happy New Year from #MarALago! Thank you to my great family for all of their support. HAPPY NEW YEAR & THANK YOU! 

I will be on FoxNews live,  with members of my family, at 11:50 P.M. We will ring in the New Year together! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I would like to wish everyone A HAPPY AND HEALTHY NEW YEAR. WE MUST ALL WORK TOGETHER TO, FINALLY, MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN AND GREAT AGAIN!

Do you believe that The State Department, on NEW YEAR'S EVE, just released more of Hillary's e-mails. They just want it all to end. BAD!

THANK YOU ILLINOIS! Let's not forget to get family & friends- out to VOTE IN 20

HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my son @DonaldJTrumpJr! Very proud of you! #TBT 

I would feel sorry for @JebBush and how badly he is doing with his campaign other than for the fact he took millions of $'s of hit ads on me

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

People ask "why do you tweet and re-tweet to millions about Jeb Bush when he is so low in the polls?" Because of his big $ hit ads on me!

Jeb Bush has spent  $630000 and is at the bottom of the polls. I have spent almost nothing and am at the top. WIN! 

A GREAT day in South Carolina. Record crowd and fantastic enthusiasm. This is now a movement to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I predict that dying @UnionLeader newspaper which has been run into the ground by publisher "Stinky" Joe McQuaid will be dead in 2 years!

A lovely letter from the daughter of the late great John Wayne. Our country could use a John Wayne right now. 

Great poll- thank you Nevada! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

I'm going to be live with @ericbolling and @kimguilfoyle to ring in the New Year 2016. Everybody should tune in to @foxnews tomorrow night!

I never thought I'd be saying this but I've really enjoyed  RichLowry on television lately and he was terrific.

The dying UnionLeader newspaper in NH is in turmoil over my comments about them- like a bully that got knocked out!

THANK YOU Council Bluffs Iowa! The silent majority is silent no more! #Trump2016 #FITN 

Joe McQuaid of the dying Union Leader wanted ads lunches donations speeches from me and tweets---very unethical.

The great people of New Hampshire who I love are not properly served by the dying Union Leader newspaper.

Shows how dumb Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) of the dying Union Leader is to put out the letter I wrote saying why I didn't do his failed debate!

I hope he does better for Rubio than he did at the #Benghazi hearings which were a total disaster for Republicans & America!

We need a real President! 

Looking forward to being in Council Bluffs Iowa later today. Despite weather rally is on -- will be fantastic! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!

So I have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place. Jeb Bush has spent $59 million & done. Run country my way!

My campaign for president is $350000 under budget I have spent very little (and am in 1st place).Now I will spend big in Iowa/N.H./S.C.

Minorities line up behind.....Donald Trump" #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

I will be interviewed on the @TODAYshow at 7:00 A.M. Talking about the state of the race for president and more. Enjoy!

Remember that Bill Clinton was brought in to help Hillary against Obama in 2008. He was terrible failed badly and was called a racist!

Thank you to a #Trump2016 supporter for this video of my campaign- over the past 6 months. Video: 

Strange but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes while he will double & triple them a disaster!

Wages in are country are too low good jobs are too few  and people have lost faith in our leaders.We need smart and strong leadership now!

Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone shipped to other countries. We now are part time sad! I WILL FIX!

The middle-class has worked so hard are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no  effective raise in years. BAD

If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband with his terrible record of women abuse while playing the women's card on me she's wrong!

Hopefully the Republican National Committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in Virginia's Republican Party. FAST!

Straighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late. Stupid!  RNC

BernieSanders-who blew his campaign when he gave Hillary a pass on her e-mail crime said that I feel wages in America are too high. Lie!

What's going on in VA? What's the GOP doing?  They will lose the state because of the RNC!

Why are JebBush flunkies Anna Navarro and SE Cupp two of the dumbest people in politics always on the CNN panels.

The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. The Dems LOVE IT! Be smart and win for a change!

R.P.Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. Will now not allow desperately needed new voters. Suicidal mistake. RNC MUST ACT NOW!

It begins Republican Party of Virginia controlled by the RNC is working hard to disallow independent unaffiliated and new voters. BAD!

I will do far more for women than Hillary and I will keep our country safe something which she will not be able to do-no strength/stamina!

Thank you! #Trump2016 

Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM so inappropriate!

If the insurance companies are making lots of money and the # of uninsured is still largeObamacare is a failure since so expensive

A new terror warning was issued for European cties. At what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart. Weak leaders!

Criminal deportations in the U.S. are the lowest number in many years. We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country. MUST CHANGE!

The Phoenix V.A. it has just been reported is in worse shape than ever before. The wait is horrendous and people are dying. I will fix it

The same people that said I wouldn't run or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%) now say I won't beat Hillary.

He is so dishonest in his reporting. And to think he was going off the air until I came along-no ratings. I will beat Hillary!

CNN just announced that TRUMP was #1 story of 2015. Totally meaningless however if we don't WIN IT ALL and Make America Great Again!

When will the Democrats and Hillary in particular say "we must build a wall a great wall and Mexico is going to pay for it?" Never!

Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A. That will stop I will fix this quickly!

Remember when failed candidate @JebBush said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE? He's spent $59 million and is at 3%.

We have many problems in our house (country!) and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now because of me starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!

She gets what is going on in politics and sees it very clearly. Have her on more!

Merry Christmas to all. Have a great day and have a really amazing year. Together we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It will be done!

Great job on CNN today. Very wise indeed!

Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video. Bad reporting. Perhaps @NBC will do better next year-but doubt it!

True a total distortion of the facts!

Very dishonest in not showing the new @CNN Poll where I am at 39% 21points higher than Cruz. Be honest Chuck!

Why isn't Chuck Todd using the much newer CNN Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older poll?

Wow because of the pressure put on by me ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It's about time!

Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton a totally flawed candidate and beating her soundly

Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing New York Times are totally in the Hillary circle of bias. Think about Bill!

Wow even lowly Rand Paul has just past @JebBush in the new @CNN Poll. Jeb is at 3% I'm at 39%. Stop throwing your money down the drain!

In the ridiculous Jeb Bush ad about me Jeb is speaking to me during the debate but doesn't allow my answer which destroys him - SO SAD!

Poor Jeb Bush spent $50 million on his campaign I spent almost nothing. He's bottom (and gone) I'm top (by a lot). That's what U.S. needs!

Hillary said "I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign." I deplore the death and destruction she caused-stupidity

Merry Christmas & Happy Holidays! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Hillary when you complain about "a penchant for sexism who are you referring to. I have great respect for women. BE CAREFUL!

It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media.  New @CNN Poll amazing in ALL categories. 21 pt. Lead

Why does FoxNews give KarlRove so much airtime. He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased. Still thinks Romney won. Unfair coverage of Trump

FoxNews treats me so badly. Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out CNN Poll. All negative!

The @washingtonpost, which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on #Amazon, today did a nasty cartoon attacking @tedcruz kids. Bad

The silent majority- is silent no more! Remember the importance of VOTING! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

The Hillary Clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic. Be careful Hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card.

Thank you America! Together- we will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 

Big news just out - NEW CNN POLL  TRUMP  39 and leads in every major category. Likeability way up. CRUZ 18  CARSON 10  RUBIO 10

We need a PRESIDENT with strength, stamina, heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again!

It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. Sad!

When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama, it meant got beaten badly. The media knows this. Often used word in politics! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Wow, new Reuters Poll just out. Big lead if you want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  TRUMP 37  CRUZ 11 This is at the top of Drudge!

For those on TV defending my use of the word "schlonged bc #MSM is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. Dishonest #MSM

Once again, MSM is dishonest. "Schlonged is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got "schlonged" that meant beaten badly.

Jeb's big ad buy against me, paid for by lobbyists, shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements. He is really pathetic!

Watching CNN and consider SE Cupp to be one of the least talented people on television. Boring and biased!

The Donald should've been named Man of the Year. He dominates the polls, news, talk shows & social media. MAGA!

Henry McMaster Lt. Governor of South Carolina who endorsed me beat failed @CNN announcer Bakari Sellers so badly. Funny!

Jeff Zucker failed @NBC and he is now failing CNN.

CNN is unwatchable. Their news on me is fiction. They are a disgrace to the broadcasting industry and an arm of the Clinton campaign.

Final poll results from NBC on last nights Commander-in-Chief Forum. Thank you! #ImWithYou #MAGA 

It wasn't Matt Lauer that hurt Hillary last night. It was her very dumb answer about emails & the veteran who said she should be in jail.

#AmericaFirst #ImWithYou

With Luis Mexico and the United States would have made wonderful deals together - where both Mexico and the US would have benefitted.

Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is highly respected by President Pe√±a Nieto.

Hillary Clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past. She is totally confused. Unfit to serve as #POTUS.

Hillary just gave a disastrous news conference on the tarmac to make up for poor performance last night. She's being decimated by the media!

Last nights winner was clear & it will be proven time & time again - lets #MAGA!! Lets WIN!! #TrumpTrain

A rough night for Hillary Clinton.

A rough night for Hillary Clinton.

Wow the reviews are in - THANK YOU!

Thank you to @foxandfriends for the nice reviews of last night.

Thank you America - great #CommanderInChiefForum polls!

Thank you to our fantastic veterans. The reviews and polls from almost everyone of my Commander-in-Chief presentation were great. Nice!

Thank you Peter - if elected I will think big for our country & never let the American people down! #AmericaFirst 

#AmericaFirst! 

Donald Trump leads Hillary Clinton by 19 points among military veteran voters. #AmericaFirst #MAGA

Message for undecided voters: Please wake up and vote DonaldTrump now! Trump/Pence very important save our America before too late!

Thank you! #AmericaFirst 

As a tribute to the late great Phyllis Schlafly I hope everybody can go out and get her latest book THE CONSERVATIVE CASE FOR TRUMP.

China wouldn't provide a red carpet stairway from Air Force One and then Philippines President calls Obama "the son of a whore." Terrible!

The truly great Phyllis Schlafly who honored me with her strong endorsement for president has passed away at 92. She was very special!

Thank you Ohio! #AmericaFirst

#LaborDay #AmericaFirst Video: 

Can you believe that the Chinese would not give Obama the proper stairway to get off his plane - fight on tarmac! 

President Obama & Putin fail to reach deal on Syria - so what else is new? Obama is not a natural deal maker. Only makes bad deals!

You are a patriot & support @realDonaldTrump. #MAGA by sticking together.

We need to show Americans that Hillary will KILL our Country !! Vote for Trump !!

It defies belief the Web of Lies Hillary is spinning! One excuse after another. Then it's this then it's that.

Lyin' Hillary Clinton told the FBI that she did not know the "C" markings on documents stood for CLASSIFIED. How can this be happening?

To the African-American community: The Democrats have failed you for fifty years high crime poor schools no jobs. I will fix it VOTE "T

The polls are close so Crooked Hillary is getting out of bed and will campaign tomorrow.Why did she hammer 13 devices and acid-wash e-mails?

The Great State of Arizona where I just had a massive rally (amazing people) has a very weak and ineffective Senator Jeff Flake. Sad!

The Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders not weak people such as @JeffFlake if it is going to stop illegal immigration.

Doesn't fit the media narrative - so they wont share what I did for Jesse Jackson in 1999 - so I will!

CNN is so biased. Never ever watch them. Trump 2016!!

Crooked Hillary's V.P. pick said this morning that I was not aware that Russia took over Crimea. A total lie - and taken over during O term!

Wow the failing New York Times has not reported properly on Crooked's FBI release. They are at the back of the pack - no longer a credible source

CNN is so disgusting in their bias but they are having a hard time promoting Crooked Hillary in light of the new e-mail scandals.

Great visit to Detroit church fantastic reception and all @CNN talks about is a small protest outside. Inside a large and wonderful crowd!

I am returning to the Pensacola Bay Center in Florida- Friday 9/9/16 at 7pm. Join me!

Great trip to Mexico today  - wonderful leadership and high quality people! Look forward to our next meeting.

Hillary Clinton didn't go to Louisiana and now she didn't go to Mexico. She doesn't have the drive or stamina to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Former President Vicente Fox who is railing against my visit to Mexico today also invited me when he apologized for using the "f bomb.

Thank you Washington! Together WE will MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN! #ImWithYou #AmericaFirst

Now that African-Americans are seeing what a bad job Hillary type policy and management has done to the inner-cities they want TRUMP!

Crooked Hillary's brainpower is highly overrated.Probably why her decision making is so bad or as stated by Bernie S she has BAD JUDGEMENT

Does anyone know that Crooked Hillary who tried so hard was unable to pass the Bar Exams in Washington D.C. She was forced to go elsewhere

I know of NO ONE voting for Crooked Hillary! Her rallies are held in theatre & she still has room.

Hillary Clinton Deleted Emails Using Program Intended To Prevent Recovery" #CrookedHillary 

How quickly people forget that Crooked Hillary called African-American youth "SUPER PREDATORS" - Has she apologized?

I am very proud to have brought the subject of illegal immigration back into the discussion. Such a big problem for our country-I will solve

Wonderful Pastor Mark Burns was attacked viciously and unfairly on MSNBC by crazy morning mika on low ratings Morning Joe. Apologize!

What do African-Americans and Hispanics have to lose by going with me. Look at the poverty crime and educational statistics. I will fix it!

Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to solve the problems of poverty education and safety within the African-American & Hispanic communities.

Flashback: Hillary Clinton Praised Former KKK Member Robert Byrd as 'Friend and Mentor': 

CLINTON CORRUPTION AND HER SABOTAGE OF THE INNER CITIES.  Full speech transcript: 

Hillary Clinton only knows how to make a speech when it is a hit on me. No policy and always very short (stamina). Media gives her a pass!

HRC is using the oldest play in the Dem playbook- when their policies fail they are left w/this one tired argument! 

Hillary Clinton is using race-baiting to try to get African-American voters- but they know she is all talk and NO ACTION!

Hillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society. She should be ashamed of herself!

Just watched recap of #CrookedHillary's speech. Very short and lies. She is the only one fear-mongering!

So many in the African-American community are doing so badly poverty and crime way up employment and jobs way down: I will fix it promise

It is being reported by virtually everyone and is a fact  that the media pile on against me is the worst in American political history!

I am now in Texas doing a big fundraiser for the Republican Party and a FoxNews Special on the BORDER and with victims of border crime!

The Washington Post quickly put together a hit job book on me- comprised of copies of some of their inaccurate stories. Don't buy boring!

Just as we won the Cold War in part by exposing the evils of communism and the virtues of free markets.... Cont: 

This is my pledge to the American people: 

It's just a 2-point race Clinton 38% Trump 36%' 

Another health insurer is pulling back due to 'persistent financial losses on #Obamacare plans.' Only the beginning! 

#AmericasMerkel 

CLINTON REFUGEE PLAN COULD BRING IN 620000 REFUGEES IN FIRST TERM AT LIFETIME COST OF OVER $400 BILLION." 

#MakeAmericaSafeAgain  

Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad!

Stay on message" is the chant. I always do - trade jobs military vets 2nd A repeal Ocare borders etc - but media misrepresents!

I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!

It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!

I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!

My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.

If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say I would be beating Hillary by 20%

The failing New York Times which never spoke to me keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False I am who I am-never said

The failing New York Times talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary!

You are a man for the people because you know what it is like to be among the people #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #USA Loves U" Thanks

We're all enjoying you as well Mr. T.! You've inspired Hope and a Positive Spirit throughout America! God bless you!" Nice

Yes you are my hero I admire you for laying down your glorious luxurious life to get beat up for America!!!

We now have confirmation as to one reason Crooked H wanted to be sure that nobody saw her e-mails - PAY-FOR-PLAY. How can she run for Pres.

PAY-FOR-PLAY

I am truly enjoying myself while running for president. The people of our country are amazing - great numbers on November 8th!

The failing New York Times has become a newspaper of fiction. Their stories about me always quote non-existent unnamed sources. Very dishonest!

Thank you Erie Pennsylvania! Together we will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 

Unbelievable support in Florida last night - thank you! #MAGA 

ISIS gained tremendous strength during Hillary Clinton's term as Secretary of State. When will the dishonest media report the facts!

I love watching these poor pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out. They can't!

They can't! They can't!

They can't!

They can't!

A massive tax increase will be necessary to fund Crooked Hillary Clinton's agenda. What a terrible (and boring) rollout that was yesterday!

hank you for coming to Pennsylvania today.

Ratings challenged CNN reports so seriously that I call President Obama (and Clinton) "the founder" of ISIS & MVP. THEY DON'T GET SARCASM?

The founder of ISIS!

Great job today by the NYPD in protecting the people and saving the climber.

Dumb as a rock.

Now cut off my mic! Bongino refuses to be bullied by Don Lemon over Trump 2nd Amendment  HEATED! 

Media desperate to distract from Clinton's anti-2A stance. I said pro-2A citizens must organize and get out vote to save our Constitution!

When is the media going to talk about Hillary's policies that have gotten people killed like Libya open borders and maybe her emails?

Heading to New Hampshire - will be talking about Hillary saying her brain SHORT CIRCUITED and other things!

Anybody whose mind "SHORT CIRCUITS" is not fit to be our president! Look up the word "BRAINWASHED.

Crooked Hillary said loudly and for the world to see that she "SHORT CIRCUITED" when answering a question on her e-mails. Very dangerous!

Hillary Clinton is being badly criticized for her poor performance in answering questions. Let us all see what happens!

Good luck #TeamUSA #OpeningCeremony #Rio2016

DRUDGE_REPORT: FORMER HOSTAGE SAYS PLANE WAITED UNTIL MONEY ARRIVED. 

DRUDGE_REPORT: 'Win-lose deal that benefits Iran and hurts United States'. 

Hillary Clinton has bad judgment and is unfit to serve as President. 

The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva Switzerland not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!

President Obama refuses to answer question about Iran terror funding.  I won't dodge questions as your President. 

Obama's disastrous judgment gave us ISIS rise of Iran and the worst economic numbers since the Great Depression!

President Obama should ask the DNC about how they rigged the election against Bernie.

During the GOP convention CNN cut away from the victims of illegal immigrant violence. They dont want them heard. 

When will CNN do a segment on Hillarys plan to increase Syrian refugees 550% and how much it will cost?

Hillary Clinton raked in money from regimes that horribly oppress women and gays & refuses to speak out against Radical Islam.

Hillary whose decisions have led to the deaths of many accepted $ from a business linked to ISIS. Silence at CNN. 

Crooked Hillary Clinton is 100% owned by her donors. #ImWithYou #MAGA 

Thank you Columbus Ohio! I will be back soon. #ImWithYou #MAGA

People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillary....that's really saying something!

The people who support Hillary sit behind CNN anchor chairs or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life.

Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary?

When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary's pay-for-play at State Department?

CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime failing schools and vanishing jobs.

CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton.

So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine they have already taken Crimea and continue to push. That's what I said!

When I said in an interview that Putin is "not going into Ukraine you can mark it down I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea!

This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!

Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice!

Wow, it is unbelievable how distorted, one-sided and biased the media is against us. The failing New York Times is a joke. CNN is laughable!

Without absolutely OWNING the liberal media, HillaryClinton wouldn't stand a chance. #VoterFraud and mainstream media her only hope.

The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H?

I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!

Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our ""leaders"" to eradicate it!

Nielson Media Research final numbers on ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: TRUMP  32.2 MILLION.  CLINTON 27.8 MILLION.  Thank you!

Thank you to all of the television viewers that made my speech at the Republican National Convention #1 over Crooked Hillary and DEMS.

NATO commander agrees members should pay up!

NATO commander agrees members should pay up!

NATO commander agrees members should pay up!

Wow, NATO's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must PAY THEIR BILLS. This is a general I will like!

The ""Rust Belt"" was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico. END!

Crooked's stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 - with Bill, VP

#CrookedHillary = Obama's third term, which would be terrible news for our economic growth - seen below. 

Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?

I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!

Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two ""Big Thursdays"" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings

#CrookedHillary 

Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster!

Violent crime is rising across the United States, yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities.

Just got back from Colorado. The love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible. Big crowds!

While I am in OH & PA - you can also join Mike Pence in Nevada on Mon!  
 
American homeownership rate in Q2 2016 was 62.9% - lowest rate in 51yrs. WE will bring back the  'American Dream!'

We are suffering through the worst long-term unemployment in the last 70 years. I want change - Crooked Hillary Clinton does not.

Hillary can never win over Bernie supporters. Her foreign wars,  NAFTA/TPP support & Wall Street ties are driving away millions of votes.

Colorado was amazing yesterday! So much support. Our tax, trade and energy reforms will bring great jobs to Colorado and the whole country.

As usual, Hillary & the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games. Same as last time w/ Bernie. Unacceptable!

What Bernie Sanders really thinks of Crooked Hillary Clinton. 

I am watching Crooked Hillary speak. Same old stuff, our country needs change!

Wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary. She sold them out, V.P. pick!

In Hillary Clinton's America - things get worse. #TrumpPence16 

The dishonest media didn't mention that Bernie Sanders was very angry looking during Crooked's speech. He wishes he didn't make that deal!

Crooked Hillary said that I ""couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign."" Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her!

If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York, he wouldn't get 10% of the vote - they would run him out of town!  #NeverHillary

Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and ""forgot"" to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream!

The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. CNN and the little watched Morning Joe = SAD!

SAD!

SAD!

SAD!

SAD!

SAD!

SAD!

SAD!

No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.

Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world.

Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety.

Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street!

Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.

Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.

Departing now - thank you Cedar Rapids, Iowa. This is a MOVEMENT! 

#CrookedHillary 

Dems warn not to underestimate Trump's potential win"" 

Great to be back in Iowa! TBT with Jerry Jr Falwell joining me in Davenport- this past winter. #MAGA 

Median household income is down for the middle class since Obama took office. It will only go further down under Clinton.

A vote for Clinton-Kaine is a vote for TPP, NAFTA, high taxes, radical regulation, and massive influx of refugees.

AMERICA'S FUTURE 

Bernie caved! 

Donald Trump Sees 17-Point Positive Swing in Two Weeks

Trump makes a funny, obvious joke about Russia going after Hillary's emails & U.S. media goes insane with fury.

Obama Refers to Himself 119 Times During Hillary Nominating Speech... 

President Obama spoke last night about a world that doesnt exist. 70% of the people think our country is going in the wrong direction. #DNC

My message is resonating with the PEOPLE

Barack is offended that I will demand that #NATO allies pay their fair share. #DemsInPhilly

Barack is offended that I will demand that #NATO allies pay their fair share. #DemsInPhilly

Our country does not feel 'great already' to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty, violence and despair.

Shooting deaths of police officers up 78% this year. We must restore law and order and protect our great law enforcement officers!

#CrookedHillary 

Thank you to our amazing law enforcement officers! #MAGA 

Trump right: Illegal families crossing border set to double, 51,152 so far"" 

Great new poll - thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton's 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI!

Join our next Vice President, Mike Pence in Wisconsin tonight & Michigan Thursday! 

Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic

Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to ""carpet bomb"" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz!

Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!

Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!

The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!

Funny how the failing New York Times is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said ""Trump is a genius."" America 1st!

As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.

Just like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP.  

Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep?

I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!

No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated!

You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is, and neither does ISIS (a good thing). Please get your facts straight - thanks. 

For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia.

In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy!

Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here.

Bernie's exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed!

The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!

Thank you New Hampshire!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

Join us in Toledo, Ohio- tomorrow night at 8pm! #TrumpPence16 #MAGA Tickets: 

Join us tomorrow in Scranton, Pennsylvania at 3pm! #TrumpPence16 #MAGA  Tickets: 

Pocahontas bombed last night! Sad to watch.

Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great

Funny, if you listen to Fox News, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference

Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.

Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!

Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.

If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.

I was at Fox News and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!

Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke!

While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.

Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War.

Thank you OHIO! #TrumpPence16 

Thank you Roanoke, Virginia- be back soon! #TrumpPence16 

MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN! #TrumpPence16 

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain  

Great POLL numbers are coming out all over. People don't want another four years of Obama, and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGA

The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!

Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!

Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!

Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her ""servant"" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie.

If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.

Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!

How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!

The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me

Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing!

The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!

The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!

The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!

Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!

Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out

If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild

The CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!

I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!

Today proves what I have always known, that Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz

Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!

There is no longer a Bernie Sanders ""political revolution."" He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!

An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.

Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!

Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!

Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT

The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!

Kaine supported the stupidest deal in the history of deals 

Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart!

The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud!

Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!

I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!

Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!

Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!

Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.

Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED

Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!

Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!

The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?

General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS! #MakeAmericaSafeAgain

I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.

Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?

Another attack, this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich.

One of the best produced, including the incredible stage & set, in the history of conventions. Great unity! Big T.V. ratings!

Thank you Cleveland. We love you and will be back many times!

What a great four days in Cleveland. So proud of the great job done by the RNC and all. The police and Secret Service were fantastic!

MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN! #RNCinCLE 

FORMAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE NOMINATION! #TrumpPence16 

You can watch 360 video live from the podium! 

This is a MOVEMENT! #RNCinCLE 

Thank you Donald J Trump Jr. Proud of you! 

Great job Ivanka Trump! #RNCinCLE 

Other than a small group of people who have suffered massive and embarrassing losses, the party is VERY united. Great love in the arena!

Ted Cruz talks about the Constitution but doesn't say that if the Dems win the Presidency, the new JUSTICES appointed will destroy us all!

I am soooo proud of my children, Don, Eric and Tiffany - their speeches, under enormous pressure, were incredible. Ivanka intros me tonight!

Great job Eric Trump! Proud of you! #AmericaFirst #RNCinCLE 

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Arena was packed, totally electric!

Mike Pence was fantastic tonight. Will be a great V.P.

Our next Vice President of the United States of America, Gov. Mike Pence!

Wow, Ted Cruz got booed off the stage, didn't honor the pledge! I saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway. No big deal!

Great job Eric Trump! Proud of you!  #AmericaFirst #RNCinCLE 

Thank you Scott Walker! #AmericaFirst  #RNCinCLE 

Thank you to Governor Scott Walker for such warm support. Great speech!

Thank you Ingraham!

#AmericaFirst #RNCinCLE  

Watching the #GOPConvention #AmericaFirst #RNCinCLE

John Kasich was never asked by me to be V.P. Just arrived in Cleveland - will be a great two days!

The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails.

Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!

In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs!

Bill Hemmer of FoxNews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. More than in past years.

Congratulations to my children, Don and Tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night. I am very proud of you!

Such a great honor to be the Republican Nominee for President of the United States. I will work hard and never let you down! AMERICA FIRST!

The ROLL CALL is beginning at the Republican National Convention. Very exciting!

Democrats are coming to TRUMP. I used to be proud of the dem party. No more It is crooked and not for the people.

It was truly an honor to introduce my wife, Melania. Her speech and demeanor were absolutely incredible. Very proud! #GOPConvention

Will be on Oreilly Factor tonight at 8:30pm @FoxNews- prior to Melania's speech at the #GOPConvention. Tune in- she will do great!  

Networks other than low ratings @CNN have been very fair and exciting!

CNN is the worst.T hey go to their dumb, one-sided panels when a podium speaker is for Trump! VAST MAJORITY want: Make America Great Again!

Looking forward to being at the convention tonight to watch all of the wonderful speakers including my wife Melania. Place looks beautiful!

President Obama just had a news conference but he doesn't have a clue. Our country is a divided crime scene and it will only get worse!

Our country is totally divided and our enemies are watching. We are not looking good we are not looking smart we are not looking tough!

Bad times for divided USA!

Bad times for divided USA!

Bad times for divided USA!

Bad times for divided USA!

We are TRYING to fight ISIS and now our own people are killing our police. Our country is divided and out of control. The world is watching

We grieve for the officers killed in Baton Rouge today. How many law enforcement and people have to... 

The ratings at Fox News blow away the ratings of CNN - not even close. That's because CNN is the Clinton News Network and people don't like

Fox News is much better and far more truthful than CNN which is all negative. Guests are stacked for Crooked Hillary! I don't watch.

If Goofy Elizabeth Warren a very weak Senator didn't lie about her heritage (being Native American) she would be nothing today. Pick her H

I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas as her V.P. Then we can litigate her fraud!

It doesn't matter that Crooked Hillary has experience look at all of the bad decisions she has made. Bernie said she has bad judgement!

As the days and weeks go by  we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in - Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions!

We are going to have a great time in Cleveland. Will lead to special results for our country. We will Make America Great Again!

Goofy Elizabeth Warren who may be the least productive Senator in the U.S. Senate must prove she is not a fraud. Without the con it's over

Thank you to Jack Morgan Tamara Neo Cheryl Ann Kraft and all of my friends and supporters in Virginia. GREAT JOB!

Great news! We've been nominated for Ireland's Best Golf Hotel 2016. We would appreciate your vote! 

Thank you to Chris Cox and Bikers for Trump - Your support has been amazing. I will never forget. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Thank you! #TrumpPence16 

Crooked Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for by Wall Street lobbyists and special interests. She will sell our country down the tubes!

Very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes Crooked Hillary Clinton can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money!

Crooked Hillary who embarrassed herself and the country with her e-mail lies has been a DISASTER on foreign policy. Look what's happening!

Crooked Hillary is spending big Wall Street money on ads saying I don't have foreign policy experience yet look what her policies have done

Look forward to introducing Governor Mike Pence (who has done a spectacular job in the great State of Indiana). My first choice from start!

Look forward to Governor Mike Pence V.P. introduction tomorrow in New York City.

I am pleased to announce that I have chosen Governor Mike Pence as my Vice Presidential running mate. News conference tomorrow at 11:00 A.M.

Four more years of weakness with a Crooked Hillary Administration is not acceptable. Look what has happened to the world with O & Hillary!

#NeverTrump is never more. They were crushed last night in Cleveland at Rules Committee by a vote of 87-12. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

My prayers and condolences to the victims and families of the terrible tragedy in Nice France. We are with you in every way!

In light of the horrible attack in Nice France I have postponed tomorrow's news conference concerning my Vice Presidential announcement.

Another horrific attack this time in Nice France. Many dead and injured. When will we learn? It is only getting worse.

I employ many people in the State of Virginia - JOBS JOBS JOBS! Crooked Hillary will sell us out just like her husband did with NAFTA.

Another new poll. Thank you for your support! Join the MOVEMENT today!  #ImWithYou 

Great new poll- thank you America! #Trump2016 #ImWithYou 

I will be making the announcement of my Vice Presidential pick on Friday at 11am in Manhattan. Details to follow.

If I win the Presidency we will swamp Justice Ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions!

Even the NYTimes and Washington Post Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach. What was she thinking?

Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge!

On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party. I am spending a lot myself and also helping others.

Voters understand that Crooked Hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity.

Despite spending $500k a day on TV ads alone #CrookedHillary falls flat in nationwide Quinnipiac Poll. Having ZERO impact. Sad!!

Despite spending $500k a day on TV ads alone #CrookedHillary falls flat in nationwide Quinnipiac Poll. Having ZERO impact. Sad!!

Sad!!

Sad!!

Lyin' Crooked Hillary's email stories all have one thing in common. 

Is President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves? Think about it and let me know!

The Republican platform is most  pro-Israel of all time!

New GOP platform now includes language that supports the border wall. We will build the wall and MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!

#CrookedHillary is outspending me by a combined 31 to 1 in Florida Ohio & Pennsylvania. I haven't started yet! 

Thank you Florida Ohio and Pennsylvania! #CrookedHillary is not qualified. 

Justice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot - resign! 

The American people agree. No free pass for #CrookedHillary! 

To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals & global special interests we welcome you with open arms. People first.

Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton.

Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.

#CrookedHillary is not qualified! 

I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. They are not happy that he is selling out!

Bernie Sanders who has lost most of his leverage has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry!

This election is a choice between law order & safety - or chaos crime & violence. I will make America safe again for everyone. #ImWithYou

For too many years our inner cities have been left behind. I am going to deliver jobs safety and protection for those in need.

Crime is out of control and rapidly getting worse. Look what is going on in Chicago and our inner cities. Not good!

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #ImWithYou 

Senior United States District Judge Robert E. Payne today ruled in favor of Trump campaign delegates who had argued..

Speech on Veterans' Reform: 

Great poll- Florida! Thank you! 

Thoughts and prayers with the victims and their families- along with everyone at the Berrien County Courthouse in St. Joseph Michigan.

Join me in Westfield Indiana- tomorrow night at 7:30pm! #Trump2016  Tickets: 

I heard that the underachieving John King of CNN on Inside Politics was one hour of lies. Happily few people are watching - dead network!

The media is so dishonest. If I make a statement they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish.They think the public is stupid!

President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. He is living in a world of the make believe!

Look what is happening to our country under the WEAK leadership of Obama and people like Crooked Hillary Clinton. We are a divided nation!

New poll - thank you! #Trump2016 

Way to go Serena Williams  - you are a true champion. Proud of you!

MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN! 

Isn't it sad that on a day of national tragedy Hillary Clinton is answering softball questions about her email lies on CNN?

Due to the horrific events taking place in our country I have decided to postpone my speech on economic opportunity- today in Miami.

Last night's horrific execution-style shootings of 12 Dallas law enforcement officers...

Prayers and condolences to all of the families who are so thoroughly devastated by the horrors we are all watching take place in our country

After today Crooked Hillary can officially be called Lyin' Crooked Hillary.

Just leaving D.C. Had great meetings with Republicans in the House and Senate. Very interesting day! These are people who love our country!

Great being in Cincinnati Ohio last night- thank you! Off to Washington D.C. now. #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst 

Where is the outrage for this Disney book? Is this the 'Star of David' also?  Dishonest media! #Frozen 

To all of my twitter followers please contribute whatever you can to the campaign. We must beat Crooked Hillary. 

Convention speaker schedule to be released tomorrow. Let today be devoted to Crooked Hillary and the rigged system under which we live.

I have over seven million hits on social media re Crooked Hillary Clinton. Check it out Sleepy Eyes 

Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd a man with so little touch for politics is at it again. He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C.

Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd a man with so little touch for politics is at it again. He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C.

Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City.

Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center Airport - and destroyed City

I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes now many bankruptcies.

Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch her time will come!

The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges but...

Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest incompetent and of very bad judgement.

Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive highly classified information." Not fit!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT!

I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with "murder." Come November 8 she's out!

Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win

FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem

The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual bad judgment.

It was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday. She has done a fantastic job for the people of Iowa and U.S. Will see her again!

Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace!

Meet the Trumps! Hope you enjoy!

Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?

Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?

With Hillary and Obama the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is "guilty as hell" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33000 missing e-mails?

The only people who are not interested in being the V.P. pick are the people who have not been asked!

I look forward to meeting Joni Ernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!

I look forward to meeting Joni Ernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!

I look forward to meeting Joni Ernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!

Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday. Very impressed great people!

Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday. Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd the end result was solid!

Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff's Star or plain star!

Happy 4th of July! #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst 

Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change!

The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this!

In Bangladesh hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed!

I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!

The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting "go away no pictures.

Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about "grandkids" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?

THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!

THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!

THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!

On Saturday a great man Elie Wiesel passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!

Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged & corrupt!

Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.

Just watched meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd and the entire show is against me.The good news-the people get it!

It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said the system is totally rigged!

It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!


Reminder: last year Clinton pledged she had turned over all work-related email under penalty of perjury  

Thank you! #AmericaFirst 

If I become the next POTUS- they will not be ignoring!  

If I become the next POTUS- they will not be ignoring!  

Crooked Hillary -- Makes History!

The #2A to our Constitution is clear. The right of the people to keep & bear Arms shall not be infringed upon. 

#AmericaFirst #ImWithYou 

The speakers slots at the Republican Convention are totally filled with a long waiting list of those that want to speak - Wednesday release

Just read in the failing New York Times that I was not aware "the event had to be held in Cleveland" - a total lie. These people are sick!

When you can't say it - or see it -- you can't fix it. We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN! #ImWithYou #AmericaFirst 

These crimes won't be happening if I'm elected POTUS. Killer should have never been here. #AmericaFirst  

Yet another terrorist attack today in Israel -- a father shot at by a Palestinian terrorist was killed while: 

Horrible killing of a 13 year old American girl at her home in Israel by a Palestinian terrorist. We must get tough. 

Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton. The system is totally rigged. Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?

Bill Clinton's meeting was a total secret. Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter.

As Bernie Sanders said Hillary Clinton has bad judgement. Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary!

The reason I put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. $50 million loan. I have totally terminated the loan!

The very dishonest NBC News refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign. Done deal!

One of the reasons Hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldn't see how she got rich- selling out America.  

Why would college graduates want Crooked Hillary as their President? She will destroy them!  

The story with Hillary will never change. 

For reasons only they can explain the US Chamber wants to continue our bad trade deals rather than renegotiating and making them better.

Tremendous day in Massachusetts and Maine. Thank you to everyone for making it so special!

As of April this year Hillary had spent $2640000 on her campaign Mr.Trump $550000. Self Funding

ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will. Not capable!

ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will. Not capable!

ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will. Not capable!

Why would the USChamber be upset by the fact that I want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that I want penalties for cheaters?

The US CHAMBER must fight harder for the American worker. China and many others are taking advantage of U.S. with our terrible trade pacts

Iron Mike Tyson was not asked to speak at the Convention though I'm sure he would do a good job if he was. The media makes everything up!

This administration is incapable of keeping our country safe!

We must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the United States.

Yet another terrorist attack this time in Turkey. Will the world ever realize what is going on? So sad.

Hillary Clintons Presidency would be catastrophic for the future of our country. She is ill-fit with bad judgment.

Benghazi is just another Hillary Clinton failure. It just never seems to work the way it's supposed to with Clinton.

Check it out - 2nd video on Lying Crooked Hillary is now online! Watch it here:  

Cancel cable - sick of their bad coverage of you and the fawning over Clinton. Listened to your great speech on YouTube


Cancel cable - sick of their bad coverage of you and the fawning over Clinton. Listened to your great speech on YouTube

Ann Coulter also can't help but notice the stock market's reaction as I was speaking. #UPUPUP

Create jobs!

Maybe If corporations weren't overtaxed they would stay.

CNN is all negative when it comes to me. I don't watch it anymore.

The media is unrelenting. They will only go with and report a story in a negative light. I called Brexit (Hillary was wrong) watch November

Crooked Hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the U.S. Senate goofy Elizabeth Warren who lied on heritage.

Under a Trump presidency America will make brilliant new trade deals!

Hillary read "sigh" off the Teleprompter She's so fake she has to be told how to feel!

W know they're fake just like poles during primary. I'm sure I will crush #CrookedHillary in general

The "dirty" poll done by ABC is a disgrace. Even they admit that many more Democrats were polled. Other polls were good.

Crooked Hillary Attacks Foreign Government Donations - While Ignoring Her Own: 

Crooked Hillary Clinton got Brexit wrong. I said LEAVE will win. She has no sense of markets and such bad judgement. Only a question of time

Hillary Clinton is not a change agent just the same old status quo! She is spending a fortune I am spending very little. Close in polls!

People in our country want borders and without them the old line pols like Crooked Hillary will not win. It is time for CHANGE -- and JOBS!

Top 50 Facts About Crooked Hillary Clinton From Trump 'Stakes Of The Election' Address: 

The ABC poll sample is heavy on Democrats.  Very dishonest - why would they do that? Other polls good!

Crooked Hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at Turnberry. Shows me hitting shot but I never did = lie! Was there to support son

Clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on BREXIT with big dollar ads. Disgraceful!

Crooked Hillary Clinton who called BREXIT 100% wrong (along with Obama) is now spending Wall Street money on an ad on my correct call.

George Will one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago) has left the Republican Party.He's made many bad calls

Just landed in New York - a one night stay in Scotland. Turnberry came out magnificently. My son Eric did a great job - under budget!

Obama has blocked ICE officers and BP from doing their jobs. That ends when I am President!

I have never liked the media term 'mass deportation' -- but we must enforce the laws of the land!

We only want to admit those who love our people and support our values. #AmericaFirst

We must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place.

So funny Crooked Hillary called BREXIT so incorrectly and now she says that she is the one to deal with the U.K. All talk no action!

Thoughts and prayers are with everyone in West Virginia- dealing with the devastating floods. #ImWithYou

And we will get it back once we have President Trump! Can't wait!

What has happened in the UK in the last 12 hours is exactly what will happen in November..vote TRUMP 2016

Many people are equating BREXIT and what is going on in Great Britain with what is happening in the U.S. People want their country back!

The opening of Trump Turnberry in Scotland was a big success. Good timing I was here for BREXIT. Very exciting news conference today!

Crooked Hillary called it totally wrong on BREXIT - she went with Obama - and now she is saying we need her to lead. She would be a disaster

I want all Americans to succeed together. President Obama's illegal executive amnesty undermines job prospects for...

New Government data by the Center for Immigration Studies shows more than 3M new legal & illegal immigrants settled..

America is proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder w/a free & ind UK. We stand together as friends as allies & as a people w/a shared history.

Self-determination is the sacred right of all free people's and the people of the UK have exercised that right for all the world to see.

Getting ready to open the magnificent Turnberry in Scotland. What a great day especially when added to the brave & brilliant vote.

Statement Regarding British Referendum on E.U. Membership 

Just arrived in Scotland. Place is going wild over the vote. They took their country back just like we will take America back. No games!

Congratulations to my son Eric on the fantastic job he has done in rebuilding Turnberry and its great Ailsa Course. Always support kids!

Leaving now for a one night trip to Scotland in order to be at the Grand Opening of my great Turnberry Resort. Will be back on Sat. night!

Meet the amazing mother whose letter I read during my speech. She lost her son to policies supported by Clinton. 

Read my full statement here on the Supreme Court's executive amnesty decision #imwithyou  

Here is another CNN lie. The Clinton News Network is losing all credibility. Im not watching it much anymore.  

CNN which is totally biased in favor of Clinton should apologize. They knew they were wrong.  

Trump's speech today is the best persuasion I have ever seen. Game over. 

Our inner cities have been left behind. We will never have the resources to support our people if we have an open border.

On immigration Im consulting with our immigration officers & our wage-earners. Hillary Clinton is consulting with Wall Street.

Obama & Clinton should stop meeting with special interests & start meeting with the victims of illegal immigration.

Hillary Clintons open borders are tearing American families apart. I am going to make our country Safe Again for all Americans. #Imwithyou

SC has kept us safe from exec amnesty--for now. But Hillary has pledged to expand it taking jobs from Hispanic & African-American workers.

I was so impressed by my speech yesterday. He was the best I've ever seen him." 

Hillary Lies to Benghazi Families #CrookedHillary  

ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama."  --  Donald J. Trump

Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency."  --   Donald J. Trump

Thank you to Donald Rumsfeld for the endorsement. Very much appreciated. Clinton's conduct has been "disqualifying.

You have great children future presidents...and we all see were raised right and out there for their father." Thank you.

Hillary says things can't change. I say they have to change. It's a choice between Americanism and her corrupt globalism. #Imwithyou

Crooked Hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief! She will be a disaster for jobs and the economy!

I will be interviewed by Lou Dobbs

Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State. She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich! Corrupt dangerous dishonest.

If you want to know about Hillary Clinton's honesty & judgment ask the family of Ambassador Stevens.

Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays.

I am "the king of debt."That has been great for me as a businessman but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt will fix U.S.

Obama-Clinton inherited $10T in debt and turned it into nearly $20T.  They have bankrupted 

Hillary Clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans - and make everyone less safe.

How can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk?

Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as Secretary of State costing Americans millions of jobs.

Hillary says this election is about judgment.  She's right.  Her judgement has killed thousands unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy.

I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton.

Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our president-really bad judgement and a temperament according to new book which is a mess!

When I said that if within the Orlando club you had some people with guns I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees

We are so proud of you Dustin. Your reaction under pressure was amazing. First of many Majors. You are a true CHAMPION!

Yesterday's failing NYTimes fraudulently shows an empty room prior to my speech when in fact it was packed! 

How can the NY Times show an empty room hours before my speech even started when they knew it was going to be packed? So totally dishonest!

My Speech Is a Game Changer.

Thank you Dallas PD!

Finally an accurate story from the Washington Post!   

Thank you Atlanta Georgia! Will be back soon! #AmericaFirst 

I will be meeting with the NRA who has endorsed me about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list or the no fly list to buy guns.

The press is so totally biased that we have no choice but to take our tough but fair and smart message directly to the people!

An: Media fell all over themselves criticizing what DonaldTrump "may have insinuated about POTUS." But he's right: 

HAPPY 241st BIRTHDAY to the @USArmy! THANK YOU! 

Thank you to the LGBT community! I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs.

AMERICA FIRST!

American must now get very tough very smart and very vigilant. We cannot admit people into our country without extraordinary screening.

Join me in Atlanta on Wednesday- at noon! #Trump2016 Tickets: 

Crooked Hillary says we must call on Saudi Arabia and other countries to stop funding hate. I am calling on- cont'd: 

Saudi Arabia and many of the countries that gave vast amounts of money to the Clinton Foundation- cont'd: 

I thought people werent celebrating? They were cheering all over even this savage from Orlando. I was right. 

In my speech on protecting America I spoke about a temporary ban which includes suspending immigration from nations tied to Islamic terror.

Based on the incredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting of the record setting Trump campaign we are hereby:  

I am no fan of President Obama but to show you how dishonest the phony Washington Post is: 

Anyone who plans to talk about Trump ever again has to see this speech.  Your opinion is irrelevant unless you listened

TERRORISM IMMIGRATION AND NATIONAL SECURITY SPEECH- TRANSCRIPT: 

I am watching FoxNews and how fairly they are treating me and my words and CNN and the total distortion of my words and what I am saying

I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror. Hillary just broke-said she would now use!

What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough

Please make us safe. We cannot have Hillary as president. We will be in so much trouble.

Reporting that Orlando killer shouted "Allah hu Akbar!" as he slaughtered clubgoers. 2nd man arrested in LA with rifles near Gay parade.

Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace!

Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism I don't want congrats I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!

Horrific incident in FL. Praying for all the victims & their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough smart & vigilant?

Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame!

Really bad shooting in Orlando. Police investigating possible terrorism. Many people dead and wounded.

Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas pretended to be a Native American in order to advance her career. Very racist!

Riley Rone was a great young man. We will miss him dearly. 

Thank you to our amazing law enforcement officers! #AmericaFirst 

Thank you Tampa Florida! #AmericaFirst #TrumpTrain 

Sad case- USATODAY did article saying I don't pay bills- false only don't pay when work is shoddy bad or not done! They should do same!

In Tampa Florida- thank you to all of our outstanding volunteers who want to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 

Don King and so many other African Americans who know me well and endorsed me would not have done so if they thought I was a racist!

Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist-but I am least racist person there is

Thank you FaithandFreedom Coalition! An honor joining you today- to discuss our shared values. #RTM2016 #Trump2016

Pocahontas is at it again! Goofy Elizabeth Warren one of the least productive U.S. Senators has a nasty mouth. Hope she is V.P. choice.

Trump's Historic 13 Million Primary Votes.

How long did it take your staff of 823 people to think that up--and where are your 33000 emails that you deleted? 

A message of condolences and support regarding the terrorist attacks in Tel Aviv:  

Obama just endorsed Crooked Hillary. He wants four more years of Obamabut nobody else does!

Crooked Hillary Clinton will be a disaster on jobs the economy trade healthcare the military guns and just about all else. Obama plus!

As expected the media is very much against me. Their dishonesty is amazing but just like our big wins in the primaries we will win!

Bernie Sanders must really dislike Crooked Hillary after the way she played him. Many of his supporters because of trade will come to me.

I would have had many millions of votes more than Crooked Hillary Clinton except for the fact that I had 16 opponents she had one!

Senator Sanders spent more than me yet lost.

THE PEOPLE NEED TRUMP2 make USA RICH!

Number one presidency of all time

Top RINO hack for MSNBC Joey Scarborough on the air and calling the next President Trump a racist and bigot. Shame on you

Nobody is watching Morning Joe anymore. Gone off the deep end - bad ratings. You won't believe what I am watching now!

Vote for me at least you'll have a job.

Thank you to all for your wonderful comments on my speech. I could feel the electricity in thr air. Great reviews - most votes ever recieved

In just out book Secret Service Agent Gary Byrne doesn't believe that Crooked Hillary has the temperament or integrity to be the president!

A former Secret Service Agent for President Clinton excoriates Crooked Hillary describing her as ERRATIC & VIOLENT. Bad temperament for pres

See when I said NATO was obsolete because of no terrorism protection they made the change without giving me credit.

My next project is pretty amazing!

Remembering the fallen heroes on DDay. 

I am getting bad marks from certain pundits because I have a small campaign staff. But small is good flexible save money and number one!

A massive blow to Obama's message - only 38000 new jobs for month in just issued jobs report. That's REALLY bad!

Crooked Hillary is being badly criticized (for a Wall Street paid for ad) by PolitiFact for a false ad on me on women. She is a total fraud!

Crooked Hillary Clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months. Her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions!

Just like I have been able to spend far less money than  others on the campaign and finish #1 so too should our country. We can be great!

People at NBC report on my campaign but have zero access. They say what they want without any knowledge.True of so much of media!

Hillary Clinton is unfit to be president. She has bad judgement poor leadership skills and a very bad and destructive track record. Change!

I am watching CNN very little lately because they are so biased against me. Shows are predictable garbage! CNN and MSM is one big lie!

The Clinton News Network sometimes referred to as @CNN is getting more and more biased.They act so indignant-hear them behind closed doors

Our ineffective POTUS has to make a speech in Elkhart to make everything look great.n

Thank you Attorney General Gonzales so many people feel this way.  

We just had the worst jobs report since 2010.

The Mayor of San Jose did a terrible job of ordering the  protection of innocent people. The thugs were lucky supporters remained peaceful!

Many of the thugs that attacked the peaceful Trump supporters in San Jose were illegals. They burned the American flag and laughed at police.

Heres The HILLARY UNIVERSITY Scandal No One In The Media Is Talking About 

Muhammad Ali is dead at 74! A truly great champion and a wonderful guy. He will be missed by all!

Great evening in San Jose other than the thugs. My supporters are far tougher if they want to be but fortunately they are not hostile.

So much interest in my visit to Scotland! I greatly look forward to attending the opening event @TrumpTurnberry- taking place on June 24th.

I'm a former chief of police in a border town. I'm Hispanic I'm proud to be Hispanic and I'm 100% behind Trump." 

In Crooked Hillary's telepromter speech yesterday she made up things that I said or believe but have no basis in fact. Not honest!

I don't watch or do @Morning_Joe anymore. Small audience low ratings! I hear Mika has gone wild with hate. Joe is Joe. They lost their way!

Rally last night in San Jose was great. Tremendous love and enthusiasm in the hall. Big crowd. Outside small group of thugs burned Am flag!

Terrible jobs report just reported. Only 38000 jobs added. Bombshell!

I think the first female president of the USA will be Ivanka Trump a beautiful intelligent young genuine successful lady!

I think the first female president of the USA will be Ivanka Trump a beautiful intelligent young genuine successful lady!

Clinton says I'm dangerous. Who's the one who killed 4 Americans in Benghazi?  

Looks like several legal Hispanics supporting Trump! They know he will be good for them too.

Back to the USA to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

After Scotland I will visit @rumpDoonbeg in Ireland the magnificent resort fronting on the Atlantic Ocean.

Beautiful article about me written by my friend the incredibly talented golfer Natalie Gulbis. 

Only Trump can save America. Right leader at the right time. THANK YOU!

She's a criminal and I'm the only person that can stop her.

THIS IS @POTUS'S LEGACY! AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER!!! WE NEED to MAGA now! 

A vote for Trump is a vote to restore our great country.

A 60% increase in Texas Blue Cross/Blue Shield through ObamaCare. I told you so there is panic and anger as healthcare costs explode!

So great to have the endorsement and support of Paul Ryan. We will both be working very hard to Make America Great Again!

Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton! Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn't even look presidential!

Crooked Hillary no longer has credibility - too much failure in office. People will not allow another four years of incompetence!

Crooked Hillary Clinton who I would love to call Lyin' Hillary is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions.

After the litigation is disposed of and the case won I have instructed my execs to open Trump U(?) so much interest in it! I will be pres.

Even though I have a very biased and unfair judge in the Trump U civil case in San Diego I have thousands of great reviews & will win case!

With all of the Crooked Hillary Clinton's foreign policy experience she has made so many mistakes - and I mean real monsters! No more HRC.

Join me in San Jose California- tonight! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 Tickets: 

Wow USA Today did todays cover story on my record in lawsuits. Verdict: 450 wins 38 losses. Isn't that what you want for your president?

Do you ever notice that CNN gives me very little proper representation on my policies. Just watched-nobody knew anything about my foreign P

Bernie Sanders was right when he said that Crooked Hillary Clinton was not qualified to be president because she suffers from BAD judgement!

Crooked Hillary Clinton has zero natural talent - she should not be president. Her temperament is bad and her decision making ability-zilch!

Same failing New York Times "reporter" who wrote discredited women's story last week wrote another terrible story on me today- will never learn!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is a fraud who has put the public and country at risk by her illegal and very stupid use of e-mails. Many missing!

So I raised/gave $5600000 for the veterans and the media makes me look bad! They do anything to belittle - totally biased.

Congratulations to Sean Hannity on his tremendous increase in television ratings. Speaking of ratings- I will be on his show tonight

I am getting great credit for my press conference today. Crooked Hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days.

Katie Couric the third rate reporter who has been largely forgotten should be ashamed of herself for the fraudulent editing of her doc.

So many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money I raised/gave! It was my great honor - they do an amazing job.

Just finished a press conference in Trump Tower wherein I gave information on which VETERANS groups got the $5600000 that I raised/gave!

I have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great VETERANS and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so. Watch!

So many great things happening - new poll numbers looking good! News conference at 11:00 A.M. today Trump Tower!

I should have easily won the Trump University case on summary judgement but have a judge Gonzalo Curiel who is totally biased against me.

I have a judge in the Trump University civil case Gonzalo Curiel (San Diego) who is very unfair. An Obama pick. Totally biased-hates Trump

I hope everyone had a great Memorial Day!

I would have had millions of votes more in the primaries (than Crooked Hillary) if I only had one opponent instead of sixteen. Broke record

Have a great Memorial Day and remember that we will soon MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Illegals are taken care of better than our veterans.  

The endorsement of me by the 16500 Border Patrol Agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate. Nice!

In getting the endorsement of the 16500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you) the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary!

Obama says a WALL at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at W.H.

I will build the wall! That I can tell you!

I will build the wall! That I can tell you!

I will build the wall! That I can tell you!

I will build the wall! That I can tell you!

If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent say good bye to the Supreme Court!

The Republican Party has to be smart & strong if it wants to win in November. Can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate!

Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser but if the GOP can't control their own then they are not a party. Be tough R's!

Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics- b/c I stand 100% behind everything we do.

Honor Memorial Day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country! We love them.

Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he's in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost. #MDW

Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me!

I am always on the front page of the failing New York Times but when I won the GOP nomination I'm in the back of the paper. Very dishonest!

The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money & get much better results! What we need as Prez!

The failing New York Times wrote a story about my management style & that I don't have many people. I have 73 Hillary has 800- & I'm beating her.

I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary - by a lot - and with many states left to go! Thank you.

The U.S. has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders. How nice but what do we get? NOT ENOUGH

Obama administration fails to screen Syrian refugees' social media accounts: 

Fantastic job on handling the thugs who tried to disrupt our very peaceful and well attended rally. Greatly appreciated!

My wife MELANIA TRUMP and my children will be featured on FoxNews

I find it offensive that Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas pretended to be Native American to get in Harvard.

Thank you Mr. & Mrs. Tom Barrack Jr for the wonderful and magical evening last night. It will not be forgotten.

The Inspector General's report on Crooked Hillary Clinton is a disaster. Such bad judgement and temperament cannot be allowed in the W.H.

Thank you Anaheim California! #Trump2016 

Thank you Washington! Honored to say on behalf of our great movement we have broken the all time record for votes in GOP primary history.

The protesters in New Mexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican flag. The rally inside was big and beautiful but outside criminals!

Crooked Hillary Clinton just can't close the deal with Bernie. I had to knock out 16 very good and smart candidates. Hillary doesn't have it

Goofy Senator Elizabeth Warren @elizabethforma has done less in the U.S. Senate than practically any other senator. All talk no action!

I blame the dishonest media.

A wonderfully written article concerning Israel. 

A great new book has been written about Crooked Hillary. Read it & you will never be able to vote for her.

Crooked Hillary Clinton overregulates overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs. Most importantly she suffers from plain old bad judgement!

I just released my financial disclosure forms the largest numbers in the history of the F.E.C. Even the dishonest media thinks great!

Amazingly with all of the money I have raised for the vets I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media.

Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups.

While under no obligation to do so I have raised between 5 & 6 million dollars including 1million dollars from me for our VETERANS. Nice!

Obamas VA Secretary just said we shouldn't measure wait times. Hillary says VA problems are not widespread. I will take care of our vets!

Is Hillary really protecting women? 

In trade military and EVERYTHING else it will be AMERICA FIRST! This will quickly lead to our ultimate goal: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

The American people are sick and tired of not being able to lead normal lives and to constantly be on the lookout for terror and terrorists!

Bernie Sanders is continuing his quest because he believes that Crooked Hillary Clinton will be forced out of the race - e-mail scandal!

Crooked Hillary wants a radical 500% increase in Syrian refugees. We cant allow this. Time to get smart and protect America!

How can Crooked Hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical Islam which horribly oppresses women?

BREAKING POLL: Trump Gains 11 Points on Clinton Since March. Now Leads Crooked Hillary 46-44 

Why do the networks continue to put dopey Bill Kristol on panels when he has called every single shot about me wrong for 2 yrs?

Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad! Would be four more years of stupidity!

Crooked Hillary said that I  want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong!

I WILL do the right thing for the U.S.A without a doubt.

Thank you to all of the men and women who have served our country. You are our true heroes! #ArmedForcesDay 

Crooked Hillary Clintons foreign interventions unleashed ISIS in Syria Iraq and Libya. She is reckless and dangerous!

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

CNN is so negative getting even worse as I get closer. Just had two anti-Trump losers with zero rebuttal from my team. Turning off!

Hillary wants to rip the guns out of America's hands. No guns = no protection. Get on #TrumpTrain & join NRA to stop her.

Crooked Hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed. No more guns to protect Hillary!

While our wonderful president was out playing golf all day the TSA is falling apart just like our government! Airports a total disaster!

Crooked Hillary is spending tremendous amounts of Wall Street money on false ads against me. She is a very dishonest person!

Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment. No gun owner can ever vote for Clinton!

Colin great to have you at Trump Turnberry. So proud of you and your GREAT playing! You made winning MAJORS look easy!

Best Links Course in Britain. Ailsa Course opens June '16 Can't wait to play it 

We will not disappoint!

Great day in Kentucky with Wayne LaPierre and the NRA!  

Failing New York Times will always take a good story about me and make it bad. Every article is unfair and biased. Very sad!

Trump is the most unpredictable extraordinary entertaining & massively popular candidate this country has ever seen.

I am on my way! See you all soon! 

Crooked Hillary can't even close the deal with Bernie - and the Dems have it rigged in favor of Hillary. Four more years of this? No way!

Crooked Hillary Clinton looks presidential? I don't think so! Four more years of Obama and our country will never come back. ISIS LAUGHS!

Look where the world is today a total mess and ISIS is still running around wild. I can fix it fast Hillary has no chance!

Crooked Hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina. ISIS China Russia and all would love for her to be president. 4 more years!

I said that Crooked Hillary Clinton is "not qualified" to be president because she has "very bad judgement" - Bernie said the same thing!

Looks like yet another terrorist attack. Airplane departed from Paris. When will we get tough smart and vigilant? Great hate and sickness!

Some low-life journalist claims that I "made a pass" at her 29 years ago. Never happened! Like the @nytimes story which has become a joke!

Why did Clinton supporters declare Crooked Hillary winner in KY when AP hasn't even called the race?

Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Democrats - the system is rigged against him. Many of his disenfranchised fans are for me!

Paul Begala the dopey CNN flunky and head of the Pro-Hillary Clinton Super PAC has knowingly committed fraud in his first ad against me.

Trump for President! Bernie is a joke knows nothing - and Hillary is yesterday's and today's nightmare

The Trump movement will not be stopped. We support Trump because he is a true American looking out for #AmericaFIRST.

Congratulations to THE MOVEMENT we have just won THE GREAT STATE OF OREGON. The vote percentage is even higher than anticipated! Thank you.

Hillary Just Handed me a huge Gift. Promising to Put Bubba in Charge of the Economy!

No way I believe Trump at 70% disapproval with women. Went to 3 rallies. At least 1/2 women. MSM Lies! MSM Lies!

Michael Barbaro the author of the now discredited New York Times hit piece on me with women has in past tweeted badly about me. He should resign

He will destroy Hillary but why give CNN record breaking ratings CNN can go to hell. Trump 2016

I look so forward to debating Crooked Hillary Clinton! Democrat Primaries are rigged e-mail investigation is rigged - so time to get it on!

I can't believe that @CNN would allow the very nice Jeffrey Lord to be savaged by a panel of seven Trump haters. 7 to 1 - Don't watch CNN!

I am a pillar of strength and will be perfect as our next president

Well that is it. Well done Megyn --- and they all lived happily ever after! Now let us all see how "THE MOVEMENT" does in Oregon tonight!

Will go back on for a final question now! Amazing job

Great interview! Happy you had a chance to show the other side. Never change never forget you are our messenger!

I like Michael Douglas!

I like Michael Douglas!

I like Michael Douglas!

I like Michael Douglas!

Best interview that I have ever seen.

One thing we know for sure Bernie Sanders supporters will turn to #Trump - absolutely not HillaryClinton

I speak from the heart for all of America. His intention is for a positive future for all. 

Wall Street paid for ad is a fraud just like Crooked Hillary! Their main line had nothing to do with women and they knew it. Apologize?

Do you think Crooked Hillary will finally close the deal? If she can't win Kentucky she should drop out of race. System rigged! 

I look forward to watching Megan Kelly. It will be interesting to see how she treats me. I think she will be very fair.

How can Crooked Hillary put her husband in charge of the economy when he was responsible for NAFTA the worst economic deal in U.S. history?

Crooked Hillary said her husband is going to be in charge of the economy.If so he should runnot her.Will he bring the "energizer" to D.C.?

Crooked Hillary can't close the deal with Bernie Sanders. Will be another bad day for her!

Amazing that Crooked Hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the WORST abuser of woman in U.S. political history

Oregon is voting today. Keep the big numbers going - VOTE TRUMP! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women. Can't believe she would misrepresent the facts! My hit was on China

The pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. "You can tell them to go BLANK themselves" - was about China NOT WOMEN!

Wow 30000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar! How can she run?

Wow 30000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar! How can she run?

Wow 30000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar! How can she run?

What Barbara Res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly and for years trying to come back. I said no.

I gave a woman named Barbara Res a top N.Y. construction job when that was unheard of and now she is nasty. So much for a nice thank you!

In politics and in life ignorance is not a virtue." This is a primary reason that President Obama is the worst president in U.S. history!

The writer of the now proven false story in the New York Times Michael Barbaro who was interviewed on CBS this morning was unable to respond.

Over 50 women were interviewed by the New York Times yet they only wrote about 6. Thats because there were so many positive statements.

No wonder the New York Times is failing who can believe what they write after the false malicious & libelous story they did on me.

The failing New York Times is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women. 

With the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing New York Times hit piece on me we have exposed the article as a fraud!

A political commentator for CNN which I no longer watch said "Trump showed some weakness in the Repub Primaries." I set all-time record!

The New York Times is so dishonest. Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer who said it was a lie!

That was an amazing interview on Fox and Friends - I hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the New York Times is!

Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Dems. The system is rigged against him. He should run as an independent! Run Bernie run.

The Washington Post report on potential VP candidates is wrong. Marco Rubio and most others mentioned are NOT under consideration.

Thank you Georgia! See you soon! #Trump2016 

The media is really on a witch-hunt against me. False reporting and plenty of it - but we will prevail!

Why did the failing New York Times refuse to use any of the names given to them that I was so proud to have helped with their careers. DISHONEST!

Wow I have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing New York Times piece. Massive front page for that!

Why doesn't the failing New York Times write the real story on the Clintons and women? The media is TOTALLY dishonest!

New York Times keep shining....the ppl will not let the media dim your light...we no longer believe them! #Trump2016" Thanks.

Everyone continues to pile onto me but they can NEVER take away our votes!"  Thank you!

Everyone is laughing at the New York Times for the lame hit piece they did on me and women.I gave them many names of women I helped-refused to use

OHIO WOMEN FOR TRUMP 

OHIO WOMEN FOR TRUMP 

OHIO WOMEN FOR TRUMP 

OHIO WOMEN FOR TRUMP 

We seem to have the same trajectory both were written off but they keep scaling the heights. History?

The failing New York Times wrote yet another hit piece on me. All are impressed with how nicely I have treated women they found nothing. A joke!

Wow CNN is really working hard to make me look as bad  as possible. Very unprofessional. Hurting in ratings - bad television! Great new poll- thank you! 

If Crooked Hillary Clinton can't close the deal on Crazy Bernie how is she going to take on China Russia ISIS and all of the others?

An incredible honor to receive the endorsement of a person I have such tremendous respect for. Thank you Sheldon! 

Your story about me & the carbon tax is absolutely incorrect. It is just the opposite. I will not support or endorse a carbon tax!

Senator Lindsey Graham called me yesterday very much to my surprise and we had a very interesting talk about national security and more!

If it were up to goofy Elizabeth Warren wed have no jobs in Americashe doesnt have a clue.

In interview I told AP that my taxes are under routine audit and I would release my tax returns when audit is complete not after election!

Isnt it funny when a failed Senator like goofy Elizabeth Warren can spend a whole day tweeting about Trump & gets nothing done in Senate?

Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage. See mediaasking for increase!

Our Native American Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren couldnt care less about the American workerdoes nothing to help!

Goofy Elizabeth Warren is now using the womans card like her friend crooked Hillary. See her dumb tweet when a woman stands up to you

If the people of Massachusetts found out what an ineffective Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren has been she would lose! Thanks Piers. 

'Duck Dynasty' star Phil Robertson says he'll back Trump for president 

Goofy Elizabeth Warren didnt have the guts to run for POTUS. Her phony Native American heritage stops that and VP cold.

Goofy Elizabeth Warren has been one of the least effective Senators in the entire U.S. Senate. She has done nothing!

I don't want to hit Crazy Bernie Sanders too hard yet because I love watching what he is doing to Crooked Hillary. His time will come!

Big wins in West Virginia and Nebraska. Get ready for November - Crooked Hillary who is looking very bad against Crazy Bernie will lose!

The Clintons spend millions on negative ads on me & I cant tell the truth about her husband? Dont feel sorry for crooked Hillary!

Hillary has bad judgment! 

It was so great being in Nebraska last week. Today is the big day--get out and vote!

I look very much forward to meeting w/Paul Ryan & the GOP Party Leadership on Thurs in DC. Together we will beat the Dems at all levels!

It is only the people that were never asked to be VP that tell the press that they will not take the position.

It was Rosie O'Donnell who ate the cake in the vicious Hillary commercial about me not Crooked Hillary!

Why does the media with a strong push from Crooked Hillary keep pushing the false narrative that I want to raise taxes. Exactly opposite!

Great job on Fox and Friends this morning. Thank you for the nice words!

For Our Children: Let's Elect Donald Trump 

I am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate. Any negotiated increase by Congress to my proposal would still be lower than current!

I will have set the all time record in primary votes in the Republican party --despite having to compete against 17 other people!

If I only had 1 person running against me in the primaries like Hillary Clinton I would have gotten 10 million more votes than she did!

Crooked Hillary Clinton says that she got more primary votes than Donald Trump. But I had 17 people to beatshe had one!  A nasty guy with no heart!

Is Chris serious lying or misinformed? Bill Clinton signed NAFTA. 

The liars that signed the pledge and now won't support me. The reason they are losers. A nasty guy with no heart!

Wow I hear Morning Joe has gone really hostile ever since I said I won't do or watch the show anymore.They misrepresent my positions!

Russell Moore is truly a terrible representative of Evangelicals and all of the good they stand for. A nasty guy with no heart!


Crooked Hillary just can't close the deal with Bernie. It will be the same way with ISIS and China on trade and Mexico at the border. Bad!

Kellyanne you were fantastic on Meet The Press today. Keep going - I will win for the people. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! HappyMothersDay!  

Kellyanne you were fantastic on Meet The Press today. Keep going - I will win for the people. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! HappyMothersDay! 

Kellyanne you were fantastic on Meet The Press today. Keep going - I will win for the people. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! HappyMothersDay! 

I want a leader that will shoot straight with us. The politicians can't.

Remember when the two failed presidential candidates Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush signed a binding PLEDGE? They broke the deal no honor!

I am honored that the great men and women of the @Teamsters have created a movement from within called Teamsters for Trump! Thank you.

I am going to keep our jobs in the U.S. and totally rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. Crooked Hillary has no clue! @Teamsters

Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk no action -- maybe her Native American name?

Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts.

Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me.

Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant but leaves behind amazing legacy.

Goofy Elizabeth Warren Hillary Clintons flunky has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American.

Lets properly check goofy Elizabeth Warrens records to see if she is Native American. I say shes a fraud!

I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.

I hear JoeNBC of rapidly fading Morning_Joe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run. This will guarantee a Crooked Hillary win.

Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed then John Kasich and that didn't work. Not much power or insight!

Thank you to teachers across America! When I become POTUS we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now.

Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability. As Bernie Sanders says she has bad judgement. Constantly playing the women's card - it is sad!

Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special the Republican Party. Wrong I didn't inherit it I won it with millions of voters! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill.

Many would say that you are the only talented person running for the top job this time!

So many great endorsements yesterday except for Paul Ryan! We must put America first and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill.

Governor Rick Perry said "Donald Trump is one of the most talented people running for the Presidency I've ever seen." Thank you Rick!

Unlike crooked Hillary Clinton who wants to destroy all miners I want wages to go up in America. We will do so by bringing back jobs! I love Hispanics! 

Thank you West Virginia. Let's keep it going. Go out and vote on Tuesday - we will win big. #Trump2016

Can you believe Crooked Hillary said "We are going to put a whole lot of coal miners&coal companies out of business." She then apologized. I love Hispanics! 

Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats. Both with delegates & otherwise. He should show them & run as an Independent.

Happy #CincoDeMayo! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! 

I love Hispanics!

I love Hispanics! 

I love Hispanics! 

I will be interviewed by @BretBaier @SpecialReport at 6pm ET tonight @FoxNews

Many reports that I will be attending the Alvarez/Khan fight this weekend in Vegas. Totally untrue! Unfortunately I have other plans.

The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill.

I would rather run against Crooked Hillary Clinton than Bernie Sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against Bernie!

What a great evening we had. So interesting that Sanders beat Crooked Hillary. The dysfunctional system is totally rigged against him!

Please correct I WON Virginia!

Thank you Indiana we were just projected to be the winner. We have won in every category. You are very special people-I will never forget!

Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will and must win Indiana. If he doesn't he should drop out of the race-stop wasting time & money.

Wow Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure - not very presidential. Sad!

I will be campaigning in Indiana all day. Things are looking great and the support of Bobby Knight has been so amazing. Today will be fun!

Everybody is talking about the protesters burning the American flags and proudly waving Mexican flags. I want America First - so do voters!

Gov Mike Pence has just stated that Donald Trump has taken a strong stance on Hoosier jobs and he thanks me! I will bring back jobs to USA.

Crooked Hillary Clinton said she is used to "dealing with men who get off the reservation." Actually she has done poorly with such men!

Karl Rove is a failed Jeb Bushy. Never says anything good & never will even after I beat Hillary. Shouldn't be on the air!

I am on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace- his 20th year anniversary with Fox News! 

I watched Sen. Graham Face The Nation. Why don't they say that I ran him out of the race like a little boy and in the end he had no support? Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will and must win Indiana. If he doesn't he should drop out of the race-stop wasting time & money.

Wow Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure - not very presidential. Sad! 

The economy is bad and getting worse-almost ZERO growth this quarter. Nobody can beat me on the economy (and jobs). MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

The "protesters" in California were thugs and criminals. Many are professionals. They should be dealt with strongly by law enforcement!

Anderson so amazing. Your mother is and always has been an incredible woman!

We are now at 1001 delegates. We will win on the first ballot and are not wasting time and effort on other ballots because system is rigged!

Crooked Hillary Clinton perhaps the most dishonest person to have ever run for the presidency is also one of the all time great enablers!

Wow the ridiculous deal made between Lyin'Ted Cruz and 1 for 42 John Kasich has just blown up. What a dumb deal - dead on arrival!

New York Yankees President Randy Levine: 'End of the Republican Party' If Donald Trump Not Nominated.   

So many false and phony T.V. commercials being broadcast in Indiana. Reminds me of Florida where thousands were put up-I won in a landslide!

I will be in Evansville Indiana with the great Bobby Knight (who last night endorsed me) at 12:00 this afternoon. See you there!

Lyin' Ted Cruz who can never beat Hillary Clinton and has NO path to victory has chosen a V.P.candidate who failed badly in her own effort

Thank you to all for the wonderful reviews of my foreign policy speech. I will soon be speaking in great detail on numerous other topics!

Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will and must win Indiana. If he doesn't he should drop out of the race-stop wasting time & money.

Wow Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure - not very presidential. Sad!

I cried when they said you made a clean sweep of all 5 states. I was SO HAPPY!

Getting the strong endorsement of the great coach Bobby Knight has been a highlight of my stay in Indiana. Big speech tomorrow with Bobby!

I am in Indiana where we just had a great rally. Fantastic people! Staying at a Holiday Inn Express - new and clean not bad! Thank you Laura!  

Thank you for the endorsement Coach Bobby Knight! I will never forget it! Thank you Newt! Thanks Dave! 

GREATEST FOREIGN POLICY SPEECH SINCE WASHINGTON'S FAREWELL ADDRESS.

Lets #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Maryland! #VoteTrump  

How bad is the New York Times the most inaccurate coverage constantly. Always trying to belittle. Paper has lost its way!

Thank you for the incredible support- Melania Barron Ivanka Jared Tiffany Don Vanessa Eric and Lara! 

Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democratsboth with delegates & otherwise. He should show them and run as an Independent! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

The Cruz-Kasich pact is under great strain. This joke of a deal is falling apart not being honored and almost dead. Very dumb!

Passing what was once a vibrant manufacturing area in Pennsylvania. So sad! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  

On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night!

Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work.

Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.

Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!

Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!

Wow just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!

I am happy to hear how badly the New York Times is doing. It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down. Becoming irrelevant!

I will be in Maryland this afternoon for a major rally. Things are looking good for Tuesday!

As soon as John Kasich is hit with negative ads he will drop like a rock in the polls against Crooked Hillary Clinton. I will win!

I had a great day campaigning in Connecticut. Looking for a big vote on Tuesday!

Congratulations to Sean Hannity on his great ratings and ratings increase as reported by the AP today. Amazing job!

Lynne Ryan -- just read your great story in the NY Times -- I am proud of you. Thanks! 

Cast your vote for Trump for POTUS & ALSO vote for the TRUMP DELEGATES in your congressional district! 

Will be spending the day campaigning in Connecticut another state where jobs are being stolen by other countries. I will stop this fast!

I met Prince on numerous occasions. He was an amazing talent and wonderful guy. He will be greatly missed!

Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted.

Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!

Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!

Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!

I will be doing the @TODAYshow with my wife Melania and the rest of my family in a major Town Hall. Hopefully it will be fun! Enjoy.7A.M.

We are going to bring steel and manufacturing back to Indiana!

Had a meeting with the terrific @GovPenceIN of Indiana. So excited to campaign in his wonderful state! 

Ted Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race. Now all he can do is be a spoiler never a nice thing to do. I will beat Hillary! 

CNN is so negative it is impossible to watch. Terrible panel angry haters.    

1988 with Oprah, I discuss why I would never rule out a run for POTUS.

Who did the House Task Force on Urgent Fiscal Issues call- when America needed HELP?  

Lyin Ted Cruz even voted against Superstorm Sandy aid and September 11th help. So many New Yorkers devastated. Cruz hates New York!

New York we will make America great again! 

Kasich only looks O.K. in polls against Hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed ZERO negative ads against him

Lyin' Ted Cruz can't win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bosses-I am millions of VOTES ahead! Hillary would destroy him & Kasich

I will fix this corrupted rigged system. 4 no Profit Under budget & ahead of schedule.

I would have millions of votes more than Hillary except for the fact that I had 17 opponents and she just had a socialist named Bernie!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. I am the one person she doesn't want to run against. Will be such fun!

Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses. It won't work!

Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary. Despite a rigged delegate system I am hundreds of delegates ahead of him.

I'll be in one of my favorite places this morning Staten Island. Big crowd will be fun!

New CBS Poll shows defections from Cruz's core supporters & increased support for me. Not surprising.

I'm starting to believe that I'm actually going to WIN!

Just arrived in Syracuse NY. Big crowd great place! We will bring back the desperately needed jobs. #NYPrimary 

We are becoming a third world country because of jerks like him" Great! We are becoming a third world country because of jerks like him" Great!

We are becoming a third world country because of jerks like him" Great! Finally someone who actually cares about us!! 

Big protest march in Colorado on Friday afternoon! Don't let the bosses take your vote!

The rules DID CHANGE in Colorado shortly after I entered the race in June because the pols and their bosses knew I would win with the voters

Biggest story in politics is now happening in the great State of Colorado where over one million people have been precluded from voting!

Missouri just confirmed #Trump2016 as the official winner- with an additional 12 delegates. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

Leaving for Albany New York now massive crowd expected. Very exciting!

Why does the liberal media think Bill O'Reilly is a complete and total vulgarian? I don't think so!

Why does the liberal media think Bill O'Reilly is a complete and total vulgarian? I don't think so!

Colorado Trump Delegates Scratched from Ballots at GOP Convention 

This is happening all over our countrygreat people being disenfranchised by politicians. Repub party is in trouble! 

The people of Colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians. Biggest story in politics. This will not be allowed!

How is it possible that the people of the great State of Colorado never got to vote in the Republican Primary? Great anger - totally unfair!

I win a state in votes and then get non-representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign. Bad system!

The New York Times purposely covers me so inaccurately. I want other nations to pay the U.S. for our defense of them. We are the suckers-no more!

New Jersey Man Joseph Hornick Willing to Go to Jail for Flying Trump Flag

GOP is trying to steal nomination from the winner not block an insurgent catching up 2 frontrunner (Sanders).

I am the only person who can save us from this corrupt political mess. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Women love Mr Trump too. Will make it happen in New York on April 19. Go out & vote.

Bernie Sanders says that Hillary Clinton is unqualified to be president. Based on her decision making ability I can go along with that!

Isn't it a shame that the person who will have by far the most delegates and many millions more votes than anyone else me still must fight

Trump will be our best president since Reagan! Nobody beats me on National Security. Looks like I was right about NATO. I had no doubt. 

Jennifer is a terrific person. Trump Cruz is hated in New York. He should go home - no place for a phony. Ted Cruz attacked New Yorkers and New York values- we don't forget! 

Jennifer is a terrific person. Trump Cruz is hated in New York. He should go home - no place for a phony. Ted Cruz attacked New Yorkers and New York values- we don't forget! 

Unbelievable evening. Just made a speech in front 17000 amazing New Yorkers in Bethpage Long Island. Great to be home! Pure fiction!

It is so great to be back home! Looking forward to a great rally tonight in Bethpage Long Island!

Wow Politico is in total disarray  with almost everybody quitting. Good news. Bad dishonest journalists! 

DonaldTrump is the only guy I think that has the will & the nerve to attack & to fight. 

VERY close to my heart. I'm a NAVY VET! I love VETERANS ADMINISTRATION REFORMS. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Wow great news from Wisconsin. Just made two speeches there with a big one coming tonight. Thank you! 

A great day in Wisconsin many stops many great people! Melania is joining me on Monday. Big crowds. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I don't care about the game I care about the PEOPLE. And that's exactly why WE THE PEOPLE love you so much! #Trump2016

CNN is reviewing the weekbut majority of the show about me because there would be 0.0 ratings if not. Media's a JOKE. Enjoy!

Thank you for your nice words on Fox today. They never use my full statements on nuclear which you would agree with!

Great honor to have GOP General Counsel John Ryder as a Trump delegate in TN. RNC meeting well worth it! Unifying the party!

Wisconsin has suffered a great loss of jobs and trade but if I win all of the bad things happening in the U.S. will be rapidly reversed!

I will be in Wisconsin until the election. Jobs trade and immigration will be big factors. I will bring jobs back home - make great deals!

If Megan Kelly stopped covering me on her show her ratings would drop like a rock! My h to h interview with Anderson Cooper beat her by millions! Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? 

Is it possible for Megan Kelly to cover anyone but Donald Trump on her terrible show. She totally misrepresents my words and positions! BAD. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! BAD.

Can you believe that Ted Cruz who has been killing our country on trade for so long just put out a Wisconsin ad talking about trade? We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States! 

We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States!

We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States!

We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States! We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States! Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? 

For the 1st time in American history Americas 16500 border patrol agents have issue a presidential primary endorsementme! Thank you.

The National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) said that our open border is the biggest physical & economic threat facing the American people! Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? 

The Club For Growth said in their ad that 465 delegates (Cruz) plus 143 delegates (Kasich) is more than my 739 delegates. Try again! Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? 

The Club For Growth which asked me for $10000 in an extortion attempt just put up a Wisconsin ad with incorrect math.What a dumb group! Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? 

Just had a very nice meeting with Reince Priebus and the @GOP. Looking forward to bringing the Party together and it will happen! The Trump Doctrine: Peace Through Strength. Nothing you say will change my mind! Congratulations to CNN for having the wisdom to pick TRUMP! 

Nice piece and video today in the Wall Street Journal: Trumps three eldest children jump into campaign 

David Gregory got thrown off of TV by NBC fired like a dog! Now he is on CNN being nasty to me. Not nice!

Final numbers's just announced in the GREAT State of MO. TRUMP WINS! New certified #'s show a 365 vote increase for me- @ least 12 more delegates!

Why is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference? What is in her hand??

This was the reporters statement- when she found out there was tape from my facility she changed her tune. 

Victory press conference was over.  Why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions? Can I press charges? 

Why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened that is before she found out the episode was on tape?

Wow Corey Lewandowski my campaign manager and a very decent man was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there!

How come the @TODAYshow & @chucktodd show the new @NBCNews Poll for Hillary vs Bernie but do not show the SAME poll where I am killing Cruz?

I have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC.

Wow CNN has nothing but my opponents on their shows. Really one-sided and unfair reporting. Maybe I shouldn't do their town-hall tonight!

We need to secure our borders ASAP. No games we must be smart tough and vigilant. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN & MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN!

Lyin' Ted I have already beaten you in all debates and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates. You should focus on jobs & illegal imm!

Lyin'Ted Cruz is weak & losing big so now he wants to debate again. But according to DrudgeTime and on-line polls I have won all debates

After the way I beat Gov. Scott Walker (and Jeb Rand Marco and all others) in the Presidential Primaries no way he would ever endorse me!

Cruz will say anything that is contrary to what you have to say. If you're for Motherhood he'll be against it!

Just released that international gangs are all over our cities. This will end when I am President!

Ted Cruz is incensed that I want to refocus NATO on terrorism as well as current mission but also want others to PAY FAIR SHARE a must!

A detainee released from Gitmo has killed an American. When will our so-called "leaders" ever learn!

The United States cannot continue to make such bad one-sided trade deals. There are only so many jobs we can give up. No more!

See Lyin' Ted even the DailyBeast says this story came from Rubio not Trump! 

Just to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than Cruz-Lawsuit coming

Why can't the pundits be honest? Hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again. I will make it strong and great!  JOBS!

Another radical Islamic attack this time in Pakistan targeting Christian women & children. At least 67 dead400 injured. I alone can solve

Happy Easter to all have a great day!

My statement on NATO being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive (and unfair) for the U.S. are now finally receiving plaudits!

Wow sleepy eyes Chuck Todd is at it again. He is do totally biased. The things I am saying are correct. - far better vision than the others

Remember I am the only candidate who is self-funding. While I am given little credit for this by the voters I am not bought like others!

Don't believe the Fox News Polls they are just another phony hit job on me. I will beat Hillary Clinton easily in the General Election.

Wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in U.S. jobs are leaving. I will make our economy strong again - bring in jobs

Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J. Trump. Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong. Illegals out!

Lyin' Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enq.were caused by me. I had NOTHING to do with story!

The press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women when they know that it is just the opposite!

The media is so after me on women  Wow this is a tough business. Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump!

Your instincts on foreign policy & terrorism have been better than all of these so called experienced politicians combined.

Top suspect in Paris massacre Salah Abdeslam who also knew of the Brussels attack is no longer talking. Weak leaders ridiculous laws!

Lyin Ted blames me for so many things I am starting to think he is having a mental health crisis.

Wow just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me. How am I still number one - by a lot?

I didn't start the fight with Lyin'Ted Cruz over the GQ cover pic of Melania he did. He knew the PAC was putting it out - hence Lyin' Ted!

Just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the Trump U case but the press refuses to write about it. If I lost-monster story! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Europe and the U.S. must immediately stop taking in people from Syria. This will be the destruction of civilization as we know it! So sad!

Just announced that as many as 5000 ISIS fighters have infiltrated Europe. Also many in U.S.  I TOLD YOU SO! I alone can fix this problem!

They're all brain-dead puppets with skeletons in their closet. I say you go on and destroy them all" A dead show

Explain how the women on The View which is a total disaster since the great Barbara Walters left ever got their jobs. @abc is wasting time

The View which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air is constantly asking me to go on.

The View which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air is constantly asking me to go on. I TELL THEM "NO

Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years. TIME FOR A CHANGE I WILL SOLVE AND FAST! Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years. TIME FOR A CHANGE I WILL SOLVE AND FAST!

It is amazing how often I am right only to be criticized by the media. Illegal immigration take the oil build the wall Muslims NATO!

Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a "hell hole" and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article. I was so right!

These politicians like Cruz and Graham who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years do nothing to make things better!

Lindsay Graham and Lyin' Ted Cruz are two politicians who are very much alike - ALL TALK AND NO ACTION! Both talk about ISIS do nothing!

It is amazing how Lindsey Graham gets on so many T.V. shows talking negatively about me when I beat him so badly in his pres run!

Thank God is not a politician but he's one heck of a fighter who will fight for us the people.

We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of N.A.T.O. Why? It is time to renegotiate and the time is now!

N.A.T.O. is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on!

I want to thank Joe for all of his help in our historic Arizona win. Could not have done it without you Joe!

While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race!

I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted. Jeb spent more than $1500000 and got nothing. I spent a fraction of that and am first!

I will be the best by far in fighting terror. Im the only one that was right from the beginning & now Lyin Ted & others are copying me.

Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror. Shes been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are!

Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates Lyin Ted Cruz. Honestly I cant blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion!

Lyin Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me and lines from Michael Douglas just another dishonest politician.

Thank you Arizona! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpTrain 

Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania. That's why we call him Lyin' Ted!

Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices!

Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona. Thank you I will never forget!

Incompetent Hillary despite the horrible attack in Brussels today wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in.  No way!

Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful Lyin' Ted or I will spill the beans on your wife!

Pres. Obama should leave the baseball game in Cuba immediately & get home to Washington- where a #POTUS under a serious emergency belongs!

Obama and all others have been so weak and so politically correct that terror groups are forming and getting stronger! Shame.

My heart & prayers go out to all of the victims of the terrible Brussels tragedy. This madness must be stopped and I will stop it.

Watch this clip from earlier this year. Time & time again I have been right about terrorism. Its time to get tough! 

I have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody- and its not even close. Hopefully AZ and UT will be voting for me today!

President Obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in Cuba especially in the shadows of Brussels. He is being treated badly!

Do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place Brussels was. Not anymore it is from a different world! U.S. must be vigilant and smart! The media is corrupt! We The People are fighting with you.

Wow President Obama just landed in Cuba a big deal and Raul Castro wasn't even there to greet him. He greeted Pope and others. No respect

So the highly overrated anchor Megan Kelly is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show but I can't fight back? Wrong!

The protesters blocked a major highway yesterday delaying entry to my RALLY in Arizona by hours and the media blames my supporters!

Why is it that the horrendous protesters who scream curse punch shut down roads/doors during my RALLIES  are never blamed by media? SAD!

The rallies in Utah and Arizona were great! Tremendous crowds and spirit. Just returned but will be going back soon.

You are a true journalistic professional. I so agree with what you say. Keep up the great work! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Watching your show from Arizona where we just had a big rally. It is fantastic- everybody loves it!

Wow @CNN ratings are up 75% because it's "all Trump all the time." The networks are making a fortune off of me! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

If crazy Megan Kelly didn't cover me so much on her terrible show her ratings would totally tank. She is so average in so many ways!

Crazy Megan Kelly says I don't (won't) go on her show and she still gets good ratings. But almost all of her shows are negative hits on me! LYIN' TED 

Honored to be in Utah with retired General Robert C. Oaks. We are so thankful for his support and endorsement here.

Reading New York times is a total waste of time he is a clown with no awareness of the world around him- dummy!

While I have never met New York Times of the NY Times I consider him one of the dumbest of all pundits- he has no sense of the real world!

Just leaving Salt Lake City Utah- fantastic crowd with no interruptions.  Love Utah. I will be back! Utah Speaker of the House announces endorses me! 

Why haven't they released the final Missouri victory for us yet? Could it be because Cruz's guy runs Missouri?

I guess I have reached yet another "ceiling"  - 49.7% with four people. My highest Reuters poll yet! Thank you! 

Do you believe that Hillary Clinton now wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants? She should spend more time taking care of our great Vets! LYIN' TED 

Everybody should boycott the Megan Kelly show. Never worth watching. Always a hit on Trump! She is sick & the most overrated person on tv.

Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost! Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary

Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost! Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary

Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost! Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary

Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney was campaigning with John Kasich & Marco Rubio and now he is endorsing Ted Cruz. 1/2

Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney the man who "choked" and let us all down is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz. This is good for me!

Going to Salt Lake City Utah for a big rally. Lyin' Ted Cruz should not be allowed to win there.  Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary. Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary

Club for Growth letter- trying to extort $10000.00 from me. Remember I said- NO! 

Club For Growth tried to extort $10000 from me. When I said NO they went hostile with negative ads. Disgraceful!

With millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment my numbers continue to go up. Can anyone explain this?

Eric Erickson got fired like a dog from RedState and now he is the one leading opposition against me.

Eric Erickson got fired like a dog from RedState and now he is the one leading opposition against me.

Eric Erickson got fired like a dog from RedState and now he is the one leading opposition against me.

Senator Lindsey Graham made horrible statements about Senator Ted Cruz  and then he endorsed him. No wonder nobody trusts politicians!

Lyin' Ted Cruz lost all five races on Tuesday-and he was just given the jinx - a Lindsey Graham endorsement. Also backed Jeb. Lindsey got 0!

Hillary Clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life!

Who should star in a reboot of Liar Liar- Hillary Clinton or Ted Cruz? Let me know. 

Highly overrated & crazy Megan Kelly is always complaining about Trump and yet she devotes her shows to me. Focus on others Megyn!

Looking like my 5 victories on Tuesday will be just as good as if I won Ohio. Two more days and Ohio was mine!

Please explain to the dummies at the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board that I love to debate and have won according to Drudge etc. all 11 of them!

Wall Street Journal is bad at math. The good news is nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore especially me!

The reason lyin' Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem! Wow just won Missouri!

Crazy Megan Kelly is now complaining that Bill did not defend her against me. Her bad show is a total hit piece on me.Tough!

Great news that FoxNews has cancelled the additional debate. How many times can the same people ask the same question? I beat Cruz debating. Wow just won Missouri!

Crazy Megan Kelly supposedly had lyin' Ted Cruz on her show last night. Ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse. Ted can't win!

Stuart Stevens the failed campaign manager of Mitt Romney's historic loss is now telling the Republican Party what to do with Trump. Sad! Wow just won Missouri!

RT @JohnStossel: I can skate here ONLY b/c @realdonaldtrump fixed this rink after NYC govt spent $13M but FAILED! Good for Trump! 

I am making a big speech the night of the @FoxNews debate but I wish everyone well. Yesterday was a big day for me with 5 wins!

Thank you to the Governor of Florida Rick Scott for your endorsement. I greatly appreciate your support! Thank you Little Marco I agree!

In the last 2 weeks I had $35M of negative ads against me in Florida & I won in a massive landslide. The establishment should save their money! Thank you Little Marco I agree!

Yesterday was five amazing victories. Lyin Ted Cruz had zero. Things are going very well! Is this what we want for a President? Thank you Little Marco I agree! 

I only wish my wonderful daughter Tiffany could have been with us at Mar-a-Lago for our great election victory. She is a winner! Thank you Little Marco I agree!

Can't watch Crazy Megyn anymore. Talks about me at 43% but never mentions that there are four people in race. With two people big & over!

If media wasn't so biased against me I would've won all of the delegates. Megan Kelly is trying so hard to bash me. Don't worry everyone is wise to Crazy Megyn!

Word is that despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads I had a massive victory in Florida. Numbers out soon!

A lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in Florida? Hope this is false.

I will bring our jobs back to the U.S. and keep our companies from leaving. Nobody else can do it. Our economy will "sing" again.

In presidential voting so far John Kasich is ZERO for 22. So why would he be a good candidate? Hillary would beat him I will beat Hillary!

Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico now losing Ford (and many others). Kasich is weak on illegal immigration. We need strong borders now!

Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. Remember him in second debate until I put him down.

Mathematically it is statistically impossible for Kasich to get to 1237. He would need 112% of the remaining delegates to beat me

North Carolina lost 300000 manufacturing jobs and Ohio lost 400000 since 2000. Going to Mexico etc. NO MORE IF I WIN WE WILL BRING BACK! LYIN' TED 

Don't reward Mitt Romney who let us all down in the last presidential race by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA open borders etc.). LYIN' TED 

Please remember I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists! LYIN' TED 

I will bring our jobs back to America fix our military and take care of our vets end Common Core and ObamaCare protect 2nd A build WALL

Rubio is weak on illegal immigration with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in many years. He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! LYIN' TED 

Kasich voted for NAFTA a disaster for Ohio and now wants the even worse TPP approved. Vote Trump and end this madness! Who started this mess the protesters of course . And media made it worse. LYIN' TED 

Sadly this kind of stuff even happened to Ronald Reagan. There is nothing nice about it! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain. Kasich has helped decimate the coal and steel industries in Ohio. I will bring them back! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Gov Kasich voted for NAFTA which devastated Ohio and is now pushing TPP hard- bad for American workers! LYIN' TED 

The failing @nytimes is truly one of the worst newspapers. They knowingly write lies and never even call to fact check. Really bad people!

Because Gov. Kasich cannot run in the state of Pennsylvania-he cannot win the nomination- & should not be allowed to compete in Ohio on Tue.

Carly Fiorina- I agree! Ted Cruz is just another politician. All talk- no action! LYIN' TED 

Thank you Kevin. With unification of the party Republican wins will be massive!  

Gov.Kasich of Ohio just stated on a morning show that he doesn't watch politics or anything on television he only watches the @GolfChannel

Ohio Gov.Kasich voted for NAFTA from which Ohio has never recovered. Now he wants TPP which will be even worse. Ohio steel and coal dying!

Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie or my supporters will go to yours!

Wow Kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of Pennsylvania not enough signatures. Big problem! LYIN' TED 

Chaos in Chicago was a planned attack. But Hillary insists it was a spontaneous reaction to an internet

USSS did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage. He has ties to ISIS. Should be in jail! 

Do the people of Ohio know that John Kasich is STRONGLY in favor of Common Core! In other words education of your children from D.C. No way!


Just finished my second speech. 20K in Dayton & 25K in Cleveland- perfectly behaved crowd. Thanks. I love you Ohio! 

It is Clinton and Sanders people who disrupted my rally in Chicago - and then they say I must talk to my people. Phony politicians!

The last person that Hillary or Bernie want to run against is Donald Trump and that is fact!

We are asking law enforcement to check for dishonest early voting in Florida- on behalf of little Marco Rubio.  No way to run a country!

Word is-early voting in FL is very dishonest. Little Marco his State Chairman & their minions are working overtime-trying to rig the vote. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

On my way to Dayton Ohio. Will be there soon!

The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled. Will be great - love you Ohio!

Ohio had the biggest budget increase in the U.S. If it were not for striking oil they would be bust! Governor Kasich in favor of TPP fraud!

Absentee Governor Kasich voted for NAFTA and NAFTA devastated Ohio - a disaster from which it never recovered. Kasich is good for Mexico!

The organized group of people many of them thugs who shut down our First Amendment rights in Chicago have totally energized America!

I just got off the phone with the great people of Guam! Thank you for your support! #VoteTrump today!

Great news! Thank you Governor Ralph DLG Torres! #Trump2016  

It means so much to me- receiving an endorsement from Phyllis Schlafly. A truly great woman & conservative. 

Thank you St. Louis Missouri!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Rumor has it that Politico is going out of business. Losing too much money. Great news! Likewise dopey Mort Zuckerman's. Dr. Ben Carson. I concur.

Probably with all pundits saying last fall I had no chance is that shows media so out of touch with Americans

Donald Trump is your man America. He is the best!! Vote for him!" Thank you!

Wow you are all correct about FoxNews - totally biased and disgusting reporting.

Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio features Trump Univ. students in FL. attack ads- who submitted "excellent" reviews. 

It was great being in Michigan. Remember I am the only presidential candidate who will bring jobs back to the U.S.and protect car industry!

Don't believe the millions of dollars of phony television ads by lightweight Rubio and the R establishment. Dishonest people!

Leaving for North Carolina. Big crowd will be fun!

Congratulation to Adam Scott and all of the folks at Trump National Doral on producing a really great WGC Tournament. Amazing finish!

I will be using Facebook and Twitter to expose dishonest lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. A record no-show in Senate he is scamming Florida

We cannot let the failing REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT who could not stop Obama (twice) ruin the MOVEMENT with millions of  $'s in false ads!

Lindsey Graham is all over T.V. much like failed 47% candidate Mitt Romney. These nasty angry jealous  failures have ZERO credibility!

Failed presidential candidate Lindsey Graham should respect me. I destroyed his run brought him from 7% to 0% when he got out. Now nasty!

How do you fight millions of dollars of fraudulent commercials pushing for crooked politicians? I will be using Facebook & Twitter. Watch!

All of the phony T.V. commercials against me are bought and payed for by SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS the bandits that tell your pols what to do

Fraud lightweight Marco made a TV ad on TrumpU featuring 2 people who signed these letters: 

The primary plaintiff in the phony Trump University suit wants to abandon the case. Disgraceful!

Nancy Reagan the wife of a truly great President was an amazing woman. She will be missed!

David Brooks of the New York Times is closing in on being the dumbest of them all. He doesnt have a clue.

I am watching two clown announcers on Fox News as they try to build up failed presidential candidate Little Marco. Fox News is in the bag!

Romney's failed advisors like campaign mgr Stuart Stevens are all over TV telling people how to win. But they lost- don't know how to win!

As predicted Trump reaching out to make peace with Republican "establishment".  If he becomes inevitable party would be

Why did Mitt Romney BEG me for my endorsement four years ago?

I am the only one who can beat Hillary Clinton. I am not a Mitt Romney who doesn't know how to win. Hillary wants no part of "Trump

Why would the great people of Florida vote for a guy who as a Senator never even shows up to vote - worst record. Marco Rubio is a joke!

I have brought millions of people into the Republican Party while the Dems are going down. Establishment wants to kill this movement!

Failed candidate Mitt Romneywho ran one of the worst races in presidential historyis working with the establishment to bury a big "R" win!

Looks like two-time failed candidate Mitt Romney is going to be telling Republicans how to get elected. Not a good messenger!

Millions of dollars being spent on false TV ads by special interest groups who own Rubio & Cruz.When you see them think of your puppet POLS

The establishment doesn't like me because they can't control me and get me to lie to you and keep ripping you off.

Because of me the Republican Party has taken in millions of new voters a record. If they are not careful they will all leave. Sad! I would love to see the Republican party and everyone get together- and unify.

Just another desperate move by the man who should have easily beaten Barrack Obama.

Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney is having a news conference tomorrow to criticize me. 

I am going to repeal and replace ObamaCare! Read more about my positions on healthcare reform here. Fox muppets!

CNN poll just hit 49% for Trump. Interesting how my numbers have gone so far up since lightweight Marco Rubio has turned nasty. Love it!

And you and the rest of you Fox muppets refuse to HEAR HIM.

Marco Rubio lost big last night. I even beat him in Virginia where he spent so much time and money. Now his bosses are desperate and angry!

Why would anyone in Florida vote for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. Check out his credit card scam his house sale & his no show voting!

Phylis Schlafly: 'Marco Rubio Betrayed Us All' 

Little Marco Rubio treated America's ICE officers "like absolute trash" in order to pass Obama's amnesty. 

Little Marco Rubio gave amnesty to criminal aliens guilty of "sex offenses." DISGRACE! 

Little Marco Rubio is just another Washington D.C. politician that is all talk and no action. #RobotRubio 

Rubio was kicking back on his $80k boat he bought with lobbyist money and claimed it was from book sale profit lol

Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio is polling very poorly in Florida. The people can't stand him for missing so many votes - poor work ethic!

Little Marco Rubio the lightweight no show Senator from Florida is just another Washington politician. 

Mitt Romney didn't show his tax return until SEPTEMBER 212012 and then only after being humiliated by Harry R! A bad messenger for estab!

As I stated at the press conference on Friday regarding David Duke- I disavow. 

Why would the people of Texas support Ted Cruz when he has accomplished absolutely nothing for them. He is another all talk no action pol!

Little Marco Rubio the lightweight no show Senator from Florida is set to be the "puppet" of the special interest Koch brothers. WATCH!

Making a big speech in Alabama today. So many people we had to move to a football stadium! Come and join us!

I am the only Republican who will get large numbers of Dems and Indies (crossover). I will also get states that no other Republican can get.

While Hillary and I both won South Carolina by big margins Repubs got far more votes with a massive increase from past cycles.GROWING PARTY

The Republican Establishment has been pushing for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio to say anything to "hit" Trump.I signed the pledge-careful

While I hear the Koch brothers are in big financial trouble (oil) word is they have chosen little Marco Rubio the lightweight from Florida. A lot more water after this bombshell Rubio. You are an enemy of America.

It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep. It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.
It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.

It is a sad commentary little boy Marco Rubio can't win in his home state. Floridians despise him as a opportunist phony.

I started my business with very little and built it into a great company with some of the best real estate assets in the World. Amazing!

I only wish my wonderful father Fred gave me $200 million to start my business like lightweight Rubio says. He didn't - total fabrication!

Fun to watch the Democrats working so hard to win the great State of South Carolina when I just won the Republican version - amazing people!

I am self-funding my campaign and am therefore not controlled by the lobbyists and special interests like lightweight Rubio or Ted Cruz!

Tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit. After the audit no problem!

I unfairly get audited by the I.R.S. almost every single year. I have rich friends who never get audited. I wonder why?

A majority of evangelicals believe I am best equipped to save the country. #Greta

What I would do on my first day in office. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Never let them see you sweat! 

They don't like Rubio in Florida- he left them high and dry. Doesn't even show up for votes!

Lightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night. The problem is he is a choker and once a choker always a choker! Mr. Meltdown.

Wow every poll said I won the debate last night. Great honor!

Lightweight choker Marco Rubio looks like a little boy on stage. Not presidential material!

Lying Ted Cruz and lightweight choker  Marco Rubio teamed up last night in a last ditch effort to stop our great movement. They failed!

Will be at Fort Worth (Texas) Convention Center at 11:30 A.M. Big crowd - get there early! Big announcement to be made!

Why would the people of Florida vote for Marco Rubio when he defrauded them by agreeing to represent them as their Senator and then quit!

Have a good chance to win Texas on Tuesday. Cruz is a nasty guy not one Senate endorsement and despite talk gets nothing done. Loser!

I will be making a speech at 12:00 in Fort Worth Texas. Really big crowd expected. Will be talking about the debate last night-plus plus!

Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney was made to look like a fool by Senator Harry Reid & didn't release his tax returns.

FMR PRES of Mexico Vicente Fox horribly used the F word when discussing the wall. He must apologize! If I did that there would be a uproar!

Early on Ted Cruz said that if he didn't win South Carolina it's over. He didn't win- and lost to me in a landslide! Signing a recent tax return- isn't this ridiculous? 

Just for your info tax returns have 0 to do w/ someones net worth. I have already filed my financial statements w/ FEC. They are great!

Why doesnt Mitt Romney just endorse Marco Rubio already. Should have done it before NH or Nevada where he had a little sway. Too late now!

Mitt Romney who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics is now pushing me on tax returns. Dope!

Great new poll. Thank you Texas! #VoteTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

Ted Cruz is lying again. Polls are showing that I do beat Hillary Clinton head to head.

That's why we are angry. The Republican Establishment will not support you. You are who the American people want!

This Texan will be voting Trump March 1st. Cruz is a fake Texan!

Chris thank you so much for your wonderful endorsement. I will not let you down! 

When Ted Cruz quits the race and the field begins to clear I will get most of his votes - no problem!

Why would Texans vote for "liar" Ted Cruz when he was born in Canada lived there for 4 years-and remained a Canadian citizen until recently

When Mitt Romney asked me for my endorsement last time around he was so awkward and goofy that we all should have known he could not win! He's a fool!

Mitt Romney who totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool is now playing tough guy. He's a fool!

The polls show that I picked up many Jeb Bush supporters. That is how I got to 46%. When others drop out I will pick up more.  Sad but true. He's a fool! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

In all of television- the only one who said anything bad about last nights landslide victory-- was dopey @KarlRove. He should be fired!

I am self funding my campaign & don't owe anybody anything! I only owe it to the American people! 

I beat both Hillary and Bernie and I haven't even started on them yet!

MELANIA TRUMP did great on television this morning. Poised smart and strong with a big heart - so much to offer. We are all proud of you! 

Make sure you get on the Trump line and are not mislead by the Cruz people. They are bad! BE CAREFUL.

Very proud of what my father has accomplished in the past 7 months -Wishing him amazing luck and success tonight! #NVcaucus 

My wife Melania will be on Morning Joe tomorrow morning at 8:00.  

Club for Growth is the group that came to my office seeking $1 million dollars. I told them no and now they are doing negative ads.

Great. Just reported on Fox News that many people who supported JebBush are now supporting me. I knew that would happen pundits didn't!

Wow great Ohio poll. Shows me leading by 5 points beating K!

Unlike the other Republican candidates I will be in Nevada all day and night - I won't be fleeing in and out. I love & invest in Nevada!

I am growing the Republican Party tremendously - just look at the numbers way up! Democrats numbers are significantly down from years past.

TRUMP IS UNSTOPPABLE....HE IS WHAT COMMON SENSE AMERICANS WANT WHETHER REPUBLICAN INDEPENDENT OR A REAGAN DEMOCRAT.

Ed Rollins gets it. Was just on Fox News explaining how Trump wins the general election. Thank you Ed!

Ted Cruz lifts the Bible high into the air and then lies like a dog-over and over again! The Evangelicals in S.C. figured him out & said no!

Ted Cruz does not have the right "temperment" to be President. Look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm. BAD!

Wow was Ted Cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication. He used him as a scape goat-fired like a dog! Ted panicked.

Ted Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in S.C. He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration.

A big fat hit job on CNN tonight. A total waste of time to watch boring and biased. Said I would never run a dope!

Just watched the very incompetent Mitt Romney Campaign Strategist Stuart Stevens. Now I know why Mitt lost so badly. Stevens is a clown!

Ted Cruz should be disqualified from his fraudulent win in Iowa. Weak RNC and Republican leadership probably won't let this happen! Sad.

Just saw the phony ad by Cruz - totally false more dirty tricks. He got caught in so many lies - is this man crazy?

Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks. No wonder he has lost Evangelical support!

Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false - no basis in fact. Take ad down Ted. Biggest liar in politics!

Wow Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director. More dirty tricks!

It is so important to audit The Federal Reserve and yet Ted Cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done.

Thank you for your endorsement @paulteutulsr! #BikersForTrump #VoteTrumpNV Video: 

Many people are now saying I won South Carolina because of the last debate. I showed anger and the people of our country are very angry!

Florida starts early voting on March 5 extending to March 15. Absentee ballots have been sent out!

No matter what liar sleazeball says about Lyin Cruz in Tennessee. We have early voting.

I hear the Rickets family who own the Chicago Cubs are secretly spending $'s against me. They better be careful they have a lot to hide!

The reason that Ted Cruz lost the Evangelicals in S.C. is because he is a world class LIAR and Evangelicals do not like liars!

I am in Las Vegas at the best hotel (by far) Trump International. I will be working with my wonderful teams and volunteers to WIN Nevada!

A number of months ago I was not expected to win South CarolinaTed Cruz was and yet I won in a landslide - every group and category. WIN!

Just back from a dinner in West Hollywood: shocked the majority of the table was voting for Trump. 

Just back from a dinner in West Hollywood: shocked the majority of the table was voting for Trump.

The failing WSJ Wall Street Journal should fire both its pollster and its Editorial Board. Seldom has a paper been so wrong.Totally biased!

I will be live on all of the major morning talk shows. Enjoy!

Thank you Sarah Palin for your amazing help and support. Big win leaving now for Atlanta and Nevada.The people of South Carolina got it!

What a great night. Thank you South Carolina a special place with truly amazing people! LOVE

People gave me no chance in South Carolina. Now it looks like a possible win. I would be happy with a one vote victory! (HOPE)

South Carolina voters have the future of our country in their hands. Vote now (today) and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Remember that Marco Rubio is very weak on illegal immigration. South Carolina needs strength as illegals and Syrians pour in. Don't allow it

I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go!

Trump expressed concerns months after the Iraq War began while 60% of Americans still supported the war. 
TheTrump phenomenon summed up: Leadership Fighter and Winner. Not a Liar 

I am the only candidate (in many years) who is self-funding his campaign. Lobbyists and $ interests totally control all other candidates! 
TheTrump phenomenon summed up: Leadership Fighter and Winner. Not a Liar 

FoxNews is really starting to campaign hard for marcorubio. #fairandbalancedmyass"  He is weak on illegal immigration!

TheTrump phenomenon summed up: Leadership Fighter and Winner. Not a Liar 

Lying #Ted Cruz just (on election day) came out with a sneak and sleazy Robocall. He holds up the Bible but in fact is a true lowlife pol!

I'm a Regan Dem and believe in your message! God bless you and your campaign!

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Just finished two major speeches in South Carolina. Big crowds great people. Going for a third now!

Boycott all Apple products  until such time as Apple gives cellphone info to authorities regarding radical Islamic terrorist couple from Cal

Hopefully others will follow suit. Our country needs & should demand security. It is time to get tough & be smart!

I use both iPhone & Samsung. If Apple doesn't give info to authorities on the terrorists I'll only be using Samsung until they give info.

I have built so many great & complicated projects creating tens of thousands of jobs-video: 

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016  

Remember Cruz and Bush gave us Roberts who upheld #ObamaCare twice! I am the only one who will #MAKEAMERICAGREATAGAIN!

Im self-funding and I am going to take care of the people  not the special interests and insurance companies like the other candidates.

I will replace it with private plans health savings accounts & allow purchasing across state lines. Maximum choice & freedom for consumer.

I was referring to a backstop for pre-existing conditions. I will eliminate the law in its entirety & replace it w/ something much better. I agree with Marco Rubio that Ted Cruz is a liar!

I was asked about healthcare by Anderson Cooper & have been consistent- I will repeal all of #ObamaCare including the mandate period.

I agree with Marco Rubio that Ted Cruz is a liar!

.@FoxNews is changing their  theme from "fair and balanced" to "unfair and unbalanced." But dying @WSJ is worse.Their phony poll is a  joke!

New CBS National Poll just out - massive lead for Trump. The Wall Street Journal/NBC Poll is a total joke. No wonder WSJ is doing so badly!

I love being in South Carolina. We are leading big in all of the State polls - Saturday is a BIG day. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

The just out USA Today National Poll where I lead by big numbers shows that in a head to head matchup I beat both Hillary and Bernie.

Amazing that while I lead by big numbers in the new Q and and USA Today polls the the press only wants to report on the phony WSJ/NBC poll.

Jeb Bush just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses. He wants to look cool but it's far too late. 1% in Nevada!

Just out Nevada poll shows Jeb Bush at 1% he should take his dumb mouthpiece @LindseyGrahamSC and just go home.

FoxNews is so biased it is disgusting. They do not want Trump to win. All negative!

I will beat Hillary easily but Lindsey Graham says I won't and yet he got zero against me- no cred! Why does FOX put him on?

He had zero in his presidential run before dropping out in disgrace- saying the most horrible things about me on FoxNews.

Interesting how President Obama so haltingly said I "would never be president" - This from perhaps the worst president in U.S. history!

Why does Megan Kelly devote so much time on her shows to me almost always negative?  Without me her ratings would tank. Get a life Megyn!

Explain to Megan Kelly who know nothing that I will beat Hillary and win states (and dem-indie votes) that no other can!

Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

New PPP Poll just out - Trump up big Cruz Rubio and Bush down. The debate results even with a stacked RNC audience were wonderful!

Spent the full day at meetings and a major rally yesterday in South Carolina. Great people and spirit. Today will be more of the same.

New South Carolina poll from PPP. Thank you! #VoteTrumpSC 

What a night! 10000 amazing supporters in Greenville South Carolina! THANK YOU! VOTE on Saturday! #VoteTrumpSC 

Thank you for your continued support! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

RESPONSE TO THE LIES OF SENATOR CRUZ: 

JEB is a hypocrite! Used massive private "Eminent Domain" --- Just another clueless politician!  

Jeb used Eminent Domain & took advantage of a disabled vet in the process. (2/2) 

I'd like to call JEB a liar but the truth is he has no clue & never revealed that he used Eminent Domain- when criticizing me! 

Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb(!) is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center Iraq War and eco collapse? Careful!

I will be in South Carolina all week. Saturday is BIG BIG BIG! Get out and vote - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates Hillary would destroy them. Ted may not be eligible to run - born in Canada

Funny that Jeb(!) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.Then mommy now brother! Thank you! I miss my father. 

Ted Cruz along with Jeb Bush pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court. Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice but didn't!

Wow in the new CBS Poll I went way up into the forties! Thank you!

Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists & special interests - the bosses!

Loved the debate last night and almost everyone said I won but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution. All donors & special ints

Thank you for your support! TOGETHER we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Thank you! I miss my father. 

I will be on Face the Nation with John Dickerson on CBS this morning. Enjoy! Thank you! I miss my father. 

This shows what a complete & total liar Ted Cruz is- he said he wouldn't have nominated John Roberts. Really? 

Jeb is incompetent and will lose don't waste your energy on that cry baby!

Jeb is incompetent and will lose don't waste your energy on that cry baby!

Jeb is incompetent and will lose don't waste your energy on that cry baby!

Jeb is incompetent and will lose don't waste your energy on that cry baby! Thank you! I miss my father. 

Even though every poll Time Drudge etc. has me winning the debate by a lot FoxNews only puts negative people on. Biased - a total joke! Thank you! I miss my father. 

Crushed the debate! Thank you! Thank you! I miss my father. 

Hey Glenn Beck. See how I beat your boy Ted- in your own Blaze poll? Your endorsement means nothing! 

All polls have me winning debate big- Drudge TIME etc. Dopey Charles Krauthammer still nasty. He has zero cred- totally dishonest!

How can Jeb Bush beat Hillary Clinton- if he can't beat anyone else on the GOPDebate stage with $150M? I am the only one who can! Thank you! I miss my father.  

Lightweight @JebBush said tonight he didn't know his family used private eminent domain in Texas- Lie!  #GOPDebate

On the way to the #GOPDebate with my wonderful wife @MelaniaTrump. 

Ted Cruz is a cheater! He holds the Bible high and then lies and misrepresents the facts!

Nasty Ted Cruz is at it again- same dirty tricks he used w/ @RealBenCarson- saying I may not be on ballot & I hold liberal positions. LIES!

Wow! Honored to be chosen by the highly respected + accurate Washington & Lee Mock Convention. I hope you are right - I will make you proud!

The totally unexpected loss of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is a massive setback for the Conservative movement and our COUNTRY!

Love the people of South Carolina - look very much forward to the debate tonight.

@AmFree: #Trump On #Ford #Carrier Shipping #Jobs To #Mexico: Im The Only One Who Understands Whats Going On 

@ThtsWhtKelSaid: I'm fed up w/ DC playing 3 card Monty w/ our tax $'s. It's time we the people play the Trump card & take back our country

@BrandonSawyer84: @realDonaldTrump will rule #SouthCarolinaPrimary! 

@wino911:  #Trump2016 We know better than to trust the RNC 

RT @EricTrump: Nevada: Reminder that today is the LAST day to register to vote in the February 23rd caucus!

Thank you South Carolina! We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN! 

Get on Trump's List" email from the RNC was not authorized. I am self funding my campaign! Do not pay.  Email: 

A very big thank you to Bill Donohue head of The Catholic League for the wonderful interview on @CNN and article in Newsmax! Great insight

Totally unauthorized do not pay. I am self funding my campaign! Notice has just been withdrawn. #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

The RNC which is probably not on my side just illegally put out a fundraising notice saying Trump wants you to contribute to the RNC.

Now an additional 600-700 jobs in America (2000) being eliminated for move to Mexico- via Hartford Courant. 

Nice column by Bill Donahue head of Catholic League. He's a blue collar New Yorker and gets it 

I am the only one who can fix this. Very sad. Will not happen under my watch! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  

Just got back from Tampa. It was an amazing evening with an even more amazing crowd - fantastic people! Will be in South Carolina tomorrow.

Word is that little Morty Zuckermans @NYDailyNews loses more than $50 million per year---can that be possible?

When little Morty Zuckerman closes his failing @NYDailyNews will I at least be given some credit? Will happen soon.

11000 inside venue tonight in Tampa! Broke record set by Elton John in 1988 w/out musical instruments! Another 5000 outside. Will be back!

I will end illegal immigration and protect our borders! We need to MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN! #Trump2016 

Millions of $'s of false ads  paid for by lobbyists-special interests of cheater @SenTedCruz  and sleepy @JebBush are now running in S.C.


Last time lightweight @JebBush tried to knock off @marcorubio he made a total fool of himself. If he doesn't do better this time he is out!

If TedCruz doesnt clean up his act stop cheating & doing negative ads I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen.

Lightweight JebBush is spending a fortune of special interest against me in SC. False advertising- desperate and sad!

After hearing the news that they would not be able to extort $1M from me they went hostile w/ a series of incorrect & ill-informed ads.

Nothing conservative about the Club for Growth coming into my office and demanding a $1M contribution which naturally they did not get.

You must be registered Republican by February 16th to vote TRUMP in the Florida primary. 

The failing NYDailyNews destroyed by little Morty Zuckerman is preparing to close and save face by going online. It's dead!

NEVADA! Tomorrow is the deadline to register Republican.  Visit: 

How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?

Lying Cruz put out a statement Trump & Rubio are w/Obama on gay marriage." Cruz is the worst liar crazy or very dishonest. Perhaps all 3?

Weak JEB getting thrown out by management during speech. Do you think he will be this tough on Putin & others?  

THANK YOU- Baton Rouge Louisiana! WE will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! #Trump2016 

Just landed in Baton Rouge Louisiana. Reports are out that lines are three quarters of a mile to get in. Wow! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Cruz caught cold in lie after denial of push polls like lies w/ RealBenCarson. How can he preach Christian values? 

Heading to Baton Rouge Louisiana for a speech. Expecting a very large crowd! See you soon. #Trump2016  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

We are getting reports from many voters that the Cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest "pushpolls" on me. We are watching!

Jeb failed as Jeb! He gave up and enlisted Mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of Iraq). Spent $120 million.Weak-no chance!

He (or she) who hesitates is lost: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Remember it was the Republican Party with the help of Conservatives that made so many promises to their base BUT DIDN'T KEEP THEM! Hi DT

Mark Halperin showed a focus group on Morning Joe me using a very bad word. I never said the word left an open blank. Please apologize!

Jeb Bush spent more than $400000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5 I spent $30000 to come in 1st. Big difference in capability!

There are no buyers for the worthless @NYDailyNews but little Mort Zuckerman is frantically looking. It is bleeding red ink - a total loser!

I have been consistent in my opposition to Common Core. Get rid of Common Core--- keep education local! I was referring to the fact that Jeb Bush wants to keep common core.

So funny Jeb Bush called me a "highly gifted politician and a great entertainer" - I assume that is a compliment!

Such a great experience in New Hampshire - amazing people! Will be leaving for a big event in South Carolina today.

Like the worthless NYDailyNews looks like Politico will be going out of business. Bad reporting- no money no cred!

Worthless NYDailyNews which dopey Mort Zuckerman is desperately trying to sell has no buyer! Liabilities are massive!

Dopey Mort Zuckerman owner of the worthless @NYDailyNews has a major inferiority complex. Paper will close soon!

My report card grades for the 2 New Hampshire winners: DonaldTrump A: v strong energy/close. BernieSanders B+: went too long

Thank you to the people of  New Hampshire I love you! Now off to South Carolina.

We will stop heroin and other drugs from coming into New Hampshire from our open southern border. We will build a WALL and have security.

We will immediately repeal and replace ObamaCare - and nobody can do that like me. We will save $'s and have much better healthcare!

ISIS is making big threats today - no respect for U.S.A. or our "leader" - If I win it will be a very different storywith very fast results

The polls are now showing that I am the best to win the GENERAL ELECTION. States that are never in play for Repubs will be won by me. Great!

No-one has done more for people with disabilities than me. I have spent many millions of dollars to help out-and am happy to have done so!

I know the "Governors" and Jeb Bush who has gone nasty with lies is by far the weakest of the lot. His family used private eminent domain!

Remember @JebBush wants COMMON CORE (education from D.C.) and is very weak on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ("come as act of love"). Not a leader!

Now that Bush has wasted $120 million of special interest money on his failed campaign he says he would end super PACs. Sad!

Today's third stop- Londonderry New Hampshire! Thank you! #FITN #VoteTrumpNH 

America needs strong leadership. Politicians can talk but they dont get things done. Video: 

Everybody is laughing at Jeb Bush-spent $100 million and is at bottom of pack. A pathetic figure!

Jeb Bush is desperate - strongly in favor of #CommonCore and very weak on illegal immigration.

Thank you for your support at this mornings Town Hall- in Salem New Hampshire. #FITN #NHPrimary 

Jeb Bush has zero communication skills so he spent a fortune of special interest money on a Super Bowl ad. He is a weak candidate!

My two wonderful sons Don and Eric will be on @foxandfriends at 7:02 - now! Enjoy.

So far the Super Bowl is very boring - not nearly as exciting as politics - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I am in New Hampshire having a great time! Loved the #GOPDebate last night! Everybody enjoy the Super Bowl. #SuperBowlSunday #SB50

Thank you- Plymouth New Hampshire! #FITN #NHPrimary 

Thank you Newt!  

We are going to have a big event at the Verizon Wireless Arena in Manchester New Hampshire! 5K+! Join us tomorrow: 

Great to meet everyone while having breakfast @ChezVachon this morning! 

Trump Kasich Jeb and Christie all had good nights. 

The New Hampshire drug epidemic must stop. If elected POTUS- I will create borders & the drugs will stop pouring in. 

Border agent: "We might as well abolish our immigration laws altogether" 

I said this was happening long ago- I will stop this immediately!  

It never ends!  

I told you so. Our country totally lost control of illegal immigration even with criminals.  

10000 people in South Carolina unbelievable evening! Will be in New Hampshire tomorrow- love it. 

Really dumb Cheri Jacobus. Begged my people for a job. Turned her down twice and she went hostile. Major loser zero credibility!

Donald Trump loves America! He loves Americans! He loves our Vets! #TrumpSupporters 

Watch: Donald Trump OWNS A Heckler Who Said Illegal Immigrants Are The Backbone Of America 

Why vote for Trump? Unlike politicians all talk Trumps talk materializes! He will make America great again

Join me at Clemson University on Wednesday February 10th! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

Heading to South Carolina really big crowd! Will be back in New Hampshire tomorrow. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Such great support in New Hampshire. So many people are working so hard to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!

I very much look forward to tomorrows debate in New Hampshireso many things to say so much at stake. It will be an incredible evening!

Live Free or Die: A motto for the whole country to follow. #NewHampshire #FITN #VoteTrumpNH  

Big storm in New Hampshire. Moved my event to Monday. Will be there next four days.

Join us Monday February 8th @ the Verizon Wireless Arena in Manchester New Hampshire! #FITN #NHPolitics #Trump2016 

I agree. Great businessman. I like your tone tonight! Keep it up & you'll have this Democrats vote.

I will be interviewed by Anderson Cooper at 8pm on @CNN from New Hampshire. Should be very interesting!

Taking a helicopter to New Hampshire boarding now. Amazing activity planned. New UMASS poll very nice! 

Politicians are trying to chip away at the 2nd Amendment. I wont let them take away our guns! #Trump2016 Watch: 

This is the Cruz voter violation certificate sent to everyone a misdemeanor at minimum. 

As per the show an even more serious Cruz charge is the fraudulent voter violation certificate sent to everyone.


Thank you. Ted Cruz should be immediately disqualified in Iowa with each candidate moving up one notch.

Sanders says he wants to run against me because he doesn't want to run against me. He would be so easy to beat!

THANK YOU to everyone in Little Rock Arkansas tonight! A record crowd of 12K. #Trump2016 

Stop the assault on American values. Stand w/ Trump to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! #VotersSpeak: 

Thank you New Hampshire! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #FITN 

Dr. Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for "deceit and dirty tricks and lies.

Cruz just lied again- I am and have been totally against #ObamaCare- repeal and replace!

The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!

This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #CruzFraud 

I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! @FoxNews

Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.

And finally Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie!

The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud

Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.

During primetime of the Iowa Caucus Cruz put out a release that RealBenCarson was quitting the race and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.

Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!

Great job on Don Lemon tonight. Begged us for a job. We said no and she went hostile. A real dummy! CNN

On my way to New Hampshire- expecting a big and spirited crowd!  #FITN #Trump2016  

Anybody who watched all of Ted Cruz's far too long rambling overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his Howard Dean moment!

The #CruzCrew prevailed! Smart for @MarcoRubio to keep his speech short & sweet. Ditto for @realDonaldTrump who was brie

I don't believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign the only one. I will keep doing but not worth it!

I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in New Hampshire. Big crowd

The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history!

Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz & Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honor

My experience in Iowa was a great one. I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place. Nice

So nice to get an endorsement from the founder and owner of Pizza Ranch in Iowa! A great guy and great places! #CaucusForTrump

It is time to take back our country- and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! #CaucusForTrump Video: 

I will be interviewed on Face The Nation with @jdickerson this morning. Enjoy!

I am in Iowa. Will be interviewed on This Week With G Stephanopoulos this morning. ENJOY!

If I would have done the last debate a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). Also VETS got $600

By not doing the failed poorly rated debate I was able to make the point of not allowing "unfairness" - while raising $60000 for VETS.

Wow just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me will repeal & replace. He lies!

Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans scam!

Ted Cruz is totally unelectable if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN!

I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife Melania. After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State!

The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters "in violation." They are now under investigation. Bad!

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  #IACaucus #CaucusForTrump 

#IACaucus #CaucusForTrump #iCaucused #iVoted 

I want to thank evangelical Christians for the warm embrace I've received on the campaign trail. Video: 

I will be in Iowa all day and until Tuesday morning. Finally after all these years of watching stupidity we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Hillary Clinton is a major national security risk. Not presidential material! 

Amazing that Ted Cruz can't even get a Senator like @BenSasse who is easy to endorse him. Not one Senator  is endorsing Canada Ted!

The great State of Nebraska can do much better than @BenSasse as your Senator. Saw him on @greta - totally ineffective. Wants paid for pols.

The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton. At a minimum how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president?

They say that if I participated in last nights Fox debate they would have had 12 million more & would have broken the all time record.

Getting ready to take off for Nashua New Hampshire. Big crowd will be there soon. Fun!

Iowa was amazing last night. The event could not have worked out better. We raised $60000 for our great vets. They were so happy & proud

Thank you for your interest & support during last nights #GOPDebate! #IACaucus finder: 

Good morning America! Thank you for all of your support in the latest Drudge poll! 

Thank you for the kind words tonight @OMAROSA. You were great! See you soon!

I will take care of the Veterans who have served this country so bravely. #ThankAVet Video: 

An unbelievable night in Iowa with our great Veterans! We raised $60000.00 while the politicians talked! #GOPDebate

Watching biased Charles @krauthammer a @FoxNews flunky who didn't know that I won every debate in particular- the last one. Check polls!

I hear that Lyin' Cruz's man Robert Mercer a good man is very angry because Cruz lied to him about liquidating his (Teds) holdings?

I just can't be bought!

The "debate" tonight will be a total disaster - low ratings with advertisers and advertising rates dropping like a rock. I hate to see this.

On Greta 87% of the people said they would not watch the debate if I'm not in it. Wow- what an honor!

FOX debate advertising rates falling like a rock! Tune into my special event for the Veterans at 9pm EST!

Thank you- Lexington South Carolina! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

It was the childishly written & taunting PR statement by Fox that made me not do the debate more so than lightweight reporter Megan Kelly.

I am self funding my campaign so I do not owe anything to lobbyists & special interests. Should I do the GOP debate? 

By not showing I'm owning entire event. 

Even though I beat him in the first six debates especially the last one Ted Cruz wants to debate me again. Can we do it in Canada?

Just got to listen to Rush Limbaugh - the guy is fantastic! Should I do the GOP debate? 

The statement put out yesterday by @FoxNews was a disgrace to good broadcasting and journalism. Who would ever say something so nasty & dumb. Should I do the GOP debate? 

I refuse to call Megyn Kelly a bimbo because that would not be politically correct. Instead I will only call her a lightweight reporter.

Pathetic attempt by Fox to try and build up ratings for the #GOPDebate. Without me they'd have no ratings!  

Should I do the GOP debate? 

Begged me to do an event while asking organizers for $100000 for himself a bad guy!

Great honor- Rev. Jerry Falwell Jr. of Liberty University one of the most respected religious leaders in our nation has just endorsed me! 

For the great people of Iowa find your IACaucus location.

Why doesn't phony  @bobvanderplaats tell his followers all the times he asked for him and his family to stay at my hotels-didn't like paying

I will end common core. It's a disaster. 

Donald Trump retains national lead in new ABC News/WaPo poll with 37%: 

Cruz lies are almost as bad as Jeb's. These politicians will do anything to stay at the trough!

Cruz going down fast in recent polls- dropping like a rock. Lies never work!

Ted Cruz is a nervous wreck. He is making reckless charges not caring for the truth! His poll #'s are way down!

I have a touched a nerve in our country in a way that most politicians have not been able to do. 

It's time for Ted Cruz to either settle his problem with the FACT that he was born in Canada and was a citizen of Canada or get out of race

Trump +15 on Cruz in 2 weeks. Cruz may look back and ask why he ever attacked Trump. DT has killed him ever since. Love making correct predictions. National Review is over.

Fox News Poll Thank you New Hampshire! #FITN #Trump2016 

Love making correct predictions. National Review is over. 

I will make our Military so big powerful & strong that no one will mess with us. #Trump2016 

I will be on Face The Nation this morning at various times across the U.S. CBSNews  Enjoy! Love making correct predictions. National Review is over.

I will be on ABC this morning at various times across the U.S. NBCNews  Enjoy!

Love making correct predictions. National Review is over.  

Word is that crying Glenn Beck left the GOP and doesn't have the right to vote in the Republican primary. Dumb as a rock.

Serious doubt in Illinois as to whether or not Cruz can run for President. First of many challenges. 

Just left a great event in Pella. Going to church tomorrow in Muscatine Iowa.

I will be on FOX with the great Judge Jeanine tonight at 9pm EST! Enjoy! #Trump2016

.@williebosshog such an honor to get your endorsement. You are a fantastic guy! It will not be forgotten. Don and Eric say hello!

Heading now to Pella Iowa. Big crowd! Remember Trump is a big buyer of Pella windows. See you soon!

For the great people of Iowa find your #IACaucus location at 

Just left Sioux Center Iowa. My speech was very well received. Truly great people! Packed house- overflow!

A wonderful story on Iowa voters by @arappeport of the @NYTimes.  

Failing Glenn Beck lost all credibility. Not only was he fired @ FOX he would have voted for Clinton over McCain. 

Based on Megyn Kelly's conflict of interest and bias she should not be allowed to be a moderator of the next debate.

Heading to Sioux County Iowa where the crowd is amazing. Dr. Robert Jeffress will make the introduction. Make America Great Again!

Ted Cruz poll numbers are down big. Because he was born in Canada and was until recently a Canadian citizen many believe he cannot run!

I am in Iowa watching all of these phony T.V. ads by the other candidates. All bull politicians are all talk and no action-it won't happen!

.@AnnCoulter has been amazing. We will win and establish strong borders we will build a WALL and Mexico will pay. We will be great again!

I will be the greatest job-producing president in American history. #Trump2016 #VoteTrump  

Dow down almost 2000 pts since start of year but still outperforming Wall Street's investment in Jeb. JEB wants Common Core

I am in Iowa. Will be making two speeches today. Good luck to all of the great folks on the East coast. Enjoy the beauty of the storm!

A wonderful article by a writer who truly gets it. I am for the people and the people are for me. #Trump2016  

Is Cruz honest? He is in bed w/ Wall St. & is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi low interest loans. No legal disclosure & never sold off assets.

Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for #POTUS. He could be Canadian Prime Minister.

Cruz says I supported TARP which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose. Puppet!

The only reason irrelevant @GlennBeck doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times. Very few listeners - sad!

One of the National Review lightweights came to my office begging for money like a dog. Why doesn't he say that?

Just watched Jeb's ad where he desperately needed mommy to help him. Jeb, Mom can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Ted Cruz went down big in just released Reuters poll - what's going on? Is it Goldman Sachs/Citi loans or Canada?

Rush Limbaugh is great tells it as he sees it---really honorable guy! Thanks Rush! #Trump2016

The tax scam Washington Post does among the most inaccurate stories of all. Really dishonest reporting.

Just received the new Fox poll. Thank you America! #Trump2016 

Wow! New National Zogby Poll just out:.TRUMP 45. CRUZ 13. RUBIO 8. Big numbers.

Leaving Nevada now for Iowa. Things are looking good - great new polls!

New Reuters poll! Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

The dying NRO National Review has totally given up the fight against Barrack Obama. They have been losing for years. I will beat Hillary!

Wow! This might be my highest numbers yet! Thank you to my opposition- you are totally ineffective & have been for years! 

I could've sworn I saw him outside Trump Tower the other day! 

@Lisa_Milicaj: Truth be told I  never heard of The National Review until they "tried" to declare war on you. No worries you got my vote!

After spending $89 million @JebBush is at the bottom of the barrel in polls. He is ashamed to use the name "Bush" in ads. Low energy guy!

The failing National Review Magazine has just been informed by the Republican National Committee that they cannot participate in debate

Ted Cruz complains about my views on eminent domain but without it we wouldn't have roads highways airports schools or even pipelines.

Make America Great Again! #Trump2016 

The late great William F. Buckley would be ashamed of what had happened to his prize the dying National Review!

Very few people read the National Review because it only knows how to criticize but not how to lead.

National Review is a failing publication that has lost it's way. It's circulation is way down w its influence being at an all time low. Sad!

Thank you Iowa! #FITN #IACaucus #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Why does Greta have a fired Bushy like dummy John Sununu on- spewing false info? I will beat Hillary by a lot she wants no part of Trump.

Happy birthday to my friend the great @jacknicklaus - a totally special guy!

New Day on CNN treats me very badly. @AlisynCamerota is a disaster. Not going to watch anymore.

Low energy candidate JebBush has wasted $80 million on his failed presidential campaign. Millions spent on me. He should go home and relax!

Sad sack JebBush has just done another ad on me with special interest money saying I won't beat Hillary - I WILL. But he can't beat me.

So sad that CNN and many others refused to show the massive crowd at the arena yesterday in Oklahoma. Dishonest reporting!

Wacko @glennbeck is a sad answer to the @SarahPalinUSA endorsement that Cruz so desperately wanted. Glenn is a failing crying lost soul!

Trump destroyed Hillary & Sanders moved in. But he didn't destroy her. Trump did. 

Palins brand among evangelicals is as gold as the faucets in Trump tower said Ralph Reed the chairman of the Faith & Freedom Coalition.

Wow the highly respected Governor of Iowa just stated that "Ted Cruz must be defeated." Big shoker! People do not like Ted.

A true honor to receive the endorsement of John Wayne's daughter....read: 

In the just released SC poll I increased my lead by 4 points since last poll by same firm. Up by 14! Cruz dropped 3. 

Thank you for your strong testimony when welcoming me to Liberty University yesterday- @JerryJrFalwell. 

Thank you Georgia! I appreciate all of your support. #Trump2016 

Just read your complete statement. You are an amazing guy & I really appreciate your words & support. I will see you soon!

On my way to Iowa- just received new national poll numbers. Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Really disgusting that the failing New York Times allows dishonest writers to totally fabricate stories.

Dope Frank Bruni said I called many people including Karl Rove losers-true! I never called my friend @HowardStern a loser- hes a winner!

Wow new polls just out have Trump up and Cruz down - he is a nervous wreck!

I don't think Ted Cruz can even run for President until he can assure Republican voters that being born in Canada is not a problem. Doubt!

Ted Cruz is falling in the polls. He is nervous. People are worried about his place of birth and his failure to report his loans from banks!

I loved being at Liberty University today! Record setting crowd unbelievable people! Thank you Jerry and Becki! 

We launched a new series of #Trump2016 videos via Facebook. A new topic everyday! Watch: 

A great morning with everyone @LibertyU! Thank you! Off to New Hampshire now. #Trump2016  

Leaving for Liberty University. I'll be speaking today in front of a record crowd. #Trump2016

Just a reminder that Ted Cruz supported liberal Justice John Roberts who gave us #Obamacare. 

Thank you @IvankaTrump for the kind words. I am very proud of the role model you are for so many. NH & IA radio ad: 

I am self-funding my campaign - putting up my own money not controlled.  Cruz is spending $millions on ads paid for by his N.Y. bosses.

Far more killed than anticipated in radical Islamic terror attack yesterday. Get tough and smart U.S. or we won't have a country anymore!

Big announcement in Ames Iowa on Tuesday! You will not want to miss this rally! #Trump2016 

Iran is going to buy 114 jetliners with a small part of the $150 billion we are giving them...but they won't buy from U.S. rather Airbus!

In Iran deal we get 4 prisoners. They get $150 billion 7 most wanted and many off watch list. This will create great incentive for others!

Interesting read from Peggy Noonan. 

Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about & demeaning? 

Wow! Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul & $1M low int. loan from Goldman Sachs. Hypocrite

Departing NH now- great morning with record crowd in Portsmouth- in a snow storm! Thank you! 

Greatly dishonest of Ted Cruz to file a financial disclosure form & not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St

When will Ted Cruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him.

Everybody that loves the people of New York and all they have been thru should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!

If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?

Ted is the ultimate hypocrite. Says one thing for money does another for votes.  

Great new numbers. Thank you!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Ted Cruz purposely and illegally did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!

Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?

Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.

The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there!

Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!

Ted Cruz said he ""didn't know"" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable

Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so

More radical Islam attacks today - it never ends! Strengthen the borders, we must be vigilant and smart. No more being politically correct.

Just got back from Iowa - had a great time with amazing people. Will be back soon!

Top searched candidate by state, as seen in the #GOPDebate media filing center. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Sen. Lindsey Graham embarrassed himself with his failed run for President and now further embarrasses himself with endorsement of Bush.

Jeb Bush, who did poorly last night in the debate and whose chances of winning are zero, just got Graham endorsement. Graham quit at O.

Do you think Iran would have acted so tough if they were Russian sailors? Our country was humiliated.

@Bonfiredesigns: Standing with @realDonaldTrump as he defends our sailors and military and Americans in the USA 

United States looks more and more like a paper tiger. Won't be that way if I win!

Iran humiliated the United States with the capture of our 10 sailors. Horrible pictures & images. We are weak. I will NOT forget!

Stuart Stevens is a dumb guy who fails @ virtually everything he touches. Romney campaign,his book,etc. Why does @andersoncooper put him on?

Why does @CNN & @andersoncooper waste airtime by putting failed campaign strategist, Stuart Stevens - who lost BIG for Romney - on the show?

Sadly, there is no way that Ted Cruz can continue running in the Republican Primary unless he can erase doubt on eligibility. Dems will sue!

Iran toys with U.S. days before we pay them, ridiculously, billions of dollars. Don't release money. We want our hostages back NOW!

Numerous polls have me beating Hillary Clinton. In a race with her, voter turnout will be the highest in U.S. history-I get most new voters!

The State Of The Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time. New leadership fast!

Just found out that @tedcruz is spending a fortune on Iowa push polls negative to me. Not nice, but OK! New polls are great.

The #SOTU speech is really boring, slow, lethargic - very hard to watch!

The Iran deal is terrible. Why didn't we get the uranium stockpile - it was sent to Russia. #SOTU

New CBS poll. #Trump2016 

Another new Iowa poll just released. Thank you! #IACaucus #FITN 

Such a serious problem for Ted & the GOP. Great doubt, Dems will sue! Let's all work together to solve this problem. 

On my way to Cedar Falls, Iowa, now. Will be great--I love the people of Iowa!

Fantastic job on @CNN  tonight. @kayleighmcenany is a winner! @donlemon

Megan Kelly recently said that she cant be wooed by Trump. She is so average in every way, who the hell wants to woo her!

So professional of ABC news to throw out the failing Union Leader newspaper from their debate. Paper won't survive, highly unethical!

Congratulations to my friend Sly Stallone on winning a GoldenG lobe. A wonderful guy- who has created something special, well deserved!

Why does Stephanopoulos allow a hater & racist like @tavissmiley to waste good airtime? ABC can do much better than him!

Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog. For starters, try getting a new publisher!

UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows. They aren't worthy of representing the great people NH.

This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed.

If their highly unethical behavior, including begging me for ads, isnt questionable enough, they have endorsed a candidate who cant win.

I am pleased to announce that I had the Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate. 

Remember, get TIME magazine! I am on the cover. Take it out in 4 years and read it again! Just watch...

Heading now for Reno, Nevada, for a big rally. Good poll numberd all over!

In the just out @FoxNews Poll, I easily beat Hillary Clinton - and I havn't even focused on her yet. On our way: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Yesterday in Iowa was amazing - two speeches in front of two great sold out crowds. They love that I am the only candidate self-funding!

@redletter99: Trump pummels his opponents - and the press | SunHerald @realDonaldTrump "

I want to thank the people of Iowa for an unbelievable day. The crowds were amazing. Will be back Tuesday!

Will be on Meet the Press with @ChuckTodd tomorrow morning. Enjoy!

I will be interviewed by Chris Wallace on Fox tomorrow morning. Tune in!

I'm protesting the @UnionLeader from having anything to do w/ ABC debate. Their unethical record doesn't give them the right to be involved!

David brilliantly tells it like it is -- the real deal! Read it!  

Time Magazine has me on the cover this week. David Von Drehle has written one of the best stories I have ever had.

Thank you so much. Earnest must have been a great person. 

Thank you. It is a true person of character that can change his opinion & do what is right. 

Constitutional law expert  #Laurence Tribe of Harvard says ""wrong to say it (natural born citizen) is a settled matter-it isn't settled).

South Carolina rally last night was so unbelievably exciting (and fun). I am now off to Iowa for two big rallies - packed houses. Love it!

Pat Buchanan gave a fantastic interview this morning on @CNN - way to go Pat, way ahead of your time!

Love seeing union & non-union members alike are defecting to Trump. I will create jobs like no one else. Their #Dem leaders cant compete!

I hope all workers demand that their @Teamsters reps endorse Donald J. Trump. Nobody knows jobs like I do! Dont let them sell you out!

On my way to South Carolina. Big Crowd--- look forward to it!

Not good news for Jeb Bush.

Not good news for Jeb Bush.

Not good news for Jeb Bush.

Not good news for Jeb Bush.

Not good news for Jeb Bush.  

Hank Greenberg, formerly of AIG, gave $10 million to the @JebBush campaign 3 months ago. He is not happy, a total waste of money!

Great time in Burlington, Vermont. Crowd was amazing.

We could only get a small fraction of this 25k crowd in. The movement to Make America Great Again is unbelievable! 

I'm leaving now for Burlington, Vermont. It will be wild!

Joy Behar, who was fired from her last show for lack of ratings, is even worse on @TheView. We love Barbara!

The The View ABC, once great when headed by Barbara Walters, is now in total freefall. Whoopi Goldberg is terrible. Very sad!

Hillary and her friends! 

Weak & ineffective JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. False advertising!

I have an idea for @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster. Try using your last name and don't be ashamed of it!

SenTedCruz Ted--free legal advice on how to pre-empt the Dems on citizen issue. Go to court now & seek Declaratory Judgment--you will win!

Massive crowd in VT tonight. Venue not big enough. Officials say NO to outside event and sound system. Arrive early!

Man shot inside Paris police station. Just announced that terror threat is at highest level. Germany is a total mess-big crime. GET SMART!

I will be in beautiful Burlington, Vermont, tonight for a rally. Will be great fun. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

It was a very wise move that Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship 18 months ago. Senator John McCain is certainly no friend of Ted!

Macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the S&P last year, plunging 46%. Very disloyal company. Another win for Trump! Boycott.

The failing UnionLeader newspaper in N.H. just sent The Trump Organization a letter asking that we take ads. How stupid, how desperate!

Do you believe that @UnionLeader in NH was demanding ads? Look at enclosed letter from them, just received: 

I will be on @wolfblitzer for a @CNNSitRoom interview today. Please join us 5PM ET.

Huge crowd expected tomorrow night! VT Police say first come, first serve. Arrive early!

Dont like SamuelLJacksons golf swing.  Not athletic. Ive won many club championships. Play him for charity!

I dont cheat at golf but @SamuelLJackson cheatswith his game he has no choiceand stop doing commercials!

HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my son, @EricTrump! Very proud of you! 

Germany is going through massive attacks to its people  by the migrants allowed to enter the country. New Years Eve was a disaster. THINK!

I dont know SamuelLJackson, to best of my knowledge haven't played golf w/him & think he does too many TV commercials boring. Not a fan.

Wow UnionLeader circulation in NH has dropped from 75,000 to around 10bad management. No wonder they begged me for ads.

The rally in Lowell, Massachusetts, was amazing. 10,000 people going wild. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Woody Johnson, owner of the NYJets, is @JebBushs finance chairman. If Woody wouldve been w/me, he wouldve been in the playoffs, at least!

I look forward to being in Lowell, Massachusetts, today. I hear a very big crowd is expected--we will have lots of fun!


By the way, Hillary & the MSM forgot to mention that Hillary is in the  Al-Shabaab terror video. 

The worst thing Hillary could do is have her husband campaign for her. Just watch.

Iran, with all of the money and all else given to them by Obama, has wanted a way to take over Saudi Arabia & their oil. THEY JUST FOUND IT!

Does anybody remember when Bill Clinton, in 2008, worked long and hard for Hillary? She LOST! Now Bill is at it again. Just watch.

Thank you for your support in Biloxi, MS! Let's ALL get out & VOTE in 2016, so we can #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 

Hillary said that guns don't keep you safe. If she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm!

Al-Shabbab, not ISIS, just made a video on me - they all will as front-runner & if I speak out against them, which I must. Hillary lied!

Just returned from Mississippi - a great evening.

Remember, I am self-funding my campaign, the only one in either party. I'm not controlled by lobbyists or special interests-only the U.S.A.!

When I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates, beware - the candidates are mere puppets $$$$!

I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women!

Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president. Jeb Bush is a low energy individual, but Hillary is not much better!

Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL, but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant!

Jeb Bush is a low energy ""stiff"" who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls. Has no chance!

Jeb Bush is a sad case. A total embarrassment to both himself and his family, he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads!

Jeb Bush is a sad case. A total embarrassment to both himself and his family, he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads!

Massive crowds expected in Mississippi tomorrow night. Look forward to it! 

The person that Hillary Clinton least wants to run against is, by far, me. It will be the largest voter turnout ever - she will be swamped!

I have never been interested in politics but because of you I want to get my political science degree. #trump2016""  Great!

I will be going to Mississippi tomorrow night - hear the crowds are going to be massive! Look forward to it.

Well, the year has officially begun. I have many stops planned and will be working very hard to win so that we can turn our country around!

Happy New Year from #MarALago! Thank you to my great family for all of their support. HAPPY NEW YEAR & THANK YOU! 

I will be on FoxNews live,  with members of my family, at 11:50 P.M. We will ring in the New Year together! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I would like to wish everyone A HAPPY AND HEALTHY NEW YEAR. WE MUST ALL WORK TOGETHER TO, FINALLY, MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN AND GREAT AGAIN!

Do you believe that The State Department, on NEW YEAR'S EVE, just released more of Hillary's e-mails. They just want it all to end. BAD!

THANK YOU ILLINOIS! Let's not forget to get family & friends- out to VOTE IN 20

HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my son @DonaldJTrumpJr! Very proud of you! #TBT 

I would feel sorry for @JebBush and how badly he is doing with his campaign other than for the fact he took millions of $'s of hit ads on me

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

People ask "why do you tweet and re-tweet to millions about Jeb Bush when he is so low in the polls?" Because of his big $ hit ads on me!

Jeb Bush has spent  $630000 and is at the bottom of the polls. I have spent almost nothing and am at the top. WIN! 

A GREAT day in South Carolina. Record crowd and fantastic enthusiasm. This is now a movement to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I predict that dying @UnionLeader newspaper which has been run into the ground by publisher "Stinky" Joe McQuaid will be dead in 2 years!

A lovely letter from the daughter of the late great John Wayne. Our country could use a John Wayne right now. 

Great poll- thank you Nevada! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

I'm going to be live with @ericbolling and @kimguilfoyle to ring in the New Year 2016. Everybody should tune in to @foxnews tomorrow night!

I never thought I'd be saying this but I've really enjoyed  RichLowry on television lately and he was terrific.

The dying UnionLeader newspaper in NH is in turmoil over my comments about them- like a bully that got knocked out!

THANK YOU Council Bluffs Iowa! The silent majority is silent no more! #Trump2016 #FITN 

Joe McQuaid of the dying Union Leader wanted ads lunches donations speeches from me and tweets---very unethical.

The great people of New Hampshire who I love are not properly served by the dying Union Leader newspaper.

Shows how dumb Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) of the dying Union Leader is to put out the letter I wrote saying why I didn't do his failed debate!

I hope he does better for Rubio than he did at the #Benghazi hearings which were a total disaster for Republicans & America!

We need a real President! 

Looking forward to being in Council Bluffs Iowa later today. Despite weather rally is on -- will be fantastic! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!

So I have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place. Jeb Bush has spent $59 million & done. Run country my way!

My campaign for president is $350000 under budget I have spent very little (and am in 1st place).Now I will spend big in Iowa/N.H./S.C.

Minorities line up behind.....Donald Trump" #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

I will be interviewed on the @TODAYshow at 7:00 A.M. Talking about the state of the race for president and more. Enjoy!

Remember that Bill Clinton was brought in to help Hillary against Obama in 2008. He was terrible failed badly and was called a racist!

Thank you to a #Trump2016 supporter for this video of my campaign- over the past 6 months. Video: 

Strange but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes while he will double & triple them a disaster!

Wages in are country are too low good jobs are too few  and people have lost faith in our leaders.We need smart and strong leadership now!

Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone shipped to other countries. We now are part time sad! I WILL FIX!

The middle-class has worked so hard are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no  effective raise in years. BAD

If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband with his terrible record of women abuse while playing the women's card on me she's wrong!

Hopefully the Republican National Committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in Virginia's Republican Party. FAST!

Straighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late. Stupid!  RNC

BernieSanders-who blew his campaign when he gave Hillary a pass on her e-mail crime said that I feel wages in America are too high. Lie!

What's going on in VA? What's the GOP doing?  They will lose the state because of the RNC!

The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. The Dems LOVE IT! Be smart and win for a change!

R.P.Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. Will now not allow desperately needed new voters. Suicidal mistake. RNC MUST ACT NOW!

It begins Republican Party of Virginia controlled by the RNC is working hard to disallow independent unaffiliated and new voters. BAD!

I will do far more for women than Hillary and I will keep our country safe something which she will not be able to do-no strength/stamina!

Thank you! #Trump2016 

Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM so inappropriate!

If the insurance companies are making lots of money and the # of uninsured is still largeObamacare is a failure since so expensive

A new terror warning was issued for European cties. At what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart. Weak leaders!

Criminal deportations in the U.S. are the lowest number in many years. We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country. MUST CHANGE!

The Phoenix V.A. it has just been reported is in worse shape than ever before. The wait is horrendous and people are dying. I will fix it

The same people that said I wouldn't run or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%) now say I won't beat Hillary.

He is so dishonest in his reporting. And to think he was going off the air until I came along-no ratings. I will beat Hillary!

CNN just announced that TRUMP was #1 story of 2015. Totally meaningless however if we don't WIN IT ALL and Make America Great Again!

When will the Democrats and Hillary in particular say "we must build a wall a great wall and Mexico is going to pay for it?" Never!

Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A. That will stop I will fix this quickly!

Remember when failed candidate @JebBush said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE? He's spent $59 million and is at 3%.

We have many problems in our house (country!) and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now because of me starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!

She gets what is going on in politics and sees it very clearly. Have her on more!

Merry Christmas to all. Have a great day and have a really amazing year. Together we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It will be done!

Great job on CNN today. Very wise indeed!

Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video. Bad reporting. Perhaps @NBC will do better next year-but doubt it!

True a total distortion of the facts!

Very dishonest in not showing the new @CNN Poll where I am at 39% 21points higher than Cruz. Be honest Chuck!

Why isn't Chuck Todd using the much newer CNN Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older poll?

Wow because of the pressure put on by me ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It's about time!

Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton a totally flawed candidate and beating her soundly

Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing New York Times are totally in the Hillary circle of bias. Think about Bill!

Wow even lowly Rand Paul has just past @JebBush in the new @CNN Poll. Jeb is at 3% I'm at 39%. Stop throwing your money down the drain!

In the ridiculous Jeb Bush ad about me Jeb is speaking to me during the debate but doesn't allow my answer which destroys him - SO SAD!

Poor Jeb Bush spent $50 million on his campaign I spent almost nothing. He's bottom (and gone) I'm top (by a lot). That's what U.S. needs!

Hillary said "I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign." I deplore the death and destruction she caused-stupidity

Merry Christmas & Happy Holidays! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Hillary when you complain about "a penchant for sexism who are you referring to. I have great respect for women. BE CAREFUL!

It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media.  New @CNN Poll amazing in ALL categories. 21 pt. Lead

Why does FoxNews give KarlRove so much airtime. He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased. Still thinks Romney won. Unfair coverage of Trump

FoxNews treats me so badly. Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out CNN Poll. All negative!

The @washingtonpost, which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on #Amazon, today did a nasty cartoon attacking @tedcruz kids. Bad

The silent majority- is silent no more! Remember the importance of VOTING! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

The Hillary Clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic. Be careful Hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card.

Thank you America! Together- we will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 

Big news just out - NEW CNN POLL  TRUMP  39 and leads in every major category. Likeability way up. CRUZ 18  CARSON 10  RUBIO 10

We need a PRESIDENT with strength, stamina, heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again!

It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. Sad!

When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama, it meant got beaten badly. The media knows this. Often used word in politics! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Wow, new Reuters Poll just out. Big lead if you want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  TRUMP 37  CRUZ 11 This is at the top of Drudge!

For those on TV defending my use of the word "schlonged bc #MSM is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. Dishonest #MSM

Once again, MSM is dishonest. "Schlonged is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got "schlonged" that meant beaten badly.

Jeb's big ad buy against me, paid for by lobbyists, shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements. He is really pathetic!

Watching CNN and consider SE Cupp to be one of the least talented people on television. Boring and biased!

The Donald should've been named Man of the Year. He dominates the polls, news, talk shows & social media. MAGA!

Henry McMaster Lt. Governor of South Carolina who endorsed me beat failed @CNN announcer Bakari Sellers so badly. Funny!

Jeff Zucker failed @NBC and he is now failing CNN.

CNN is unwatchable. Their news on me is fiction. They are a disgrace to the broadcasting industry and an arm of the Clinton campaign.

Final poll results from NBC on last nights Commander-in-Chief Forum. Thank you! #ImWithYou #MAGA 

It wasn't Matt Lauer that hurt Hillary last night. It was her very dumb answer about emails & the veteran who said she should be in jail.

#AmericaFirst #ImWithYou

With Luis Mexico and the United States would have made wonderful deals together - where both Mexico and the US would have benefitted.

Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is highly respected by President Pe√±a Nieto.

Hillary Clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past. She is totally confused. Unfit to serve as #POTUS.

Hillary just gave a disastrous news conference on the tarmac to make up for poor performance last night. She's being decimated by the media!

Last nights winner was clear & it will be proven time & time again - lets #MAGA!! Lets WIN!! #TrumpTrain

A rough night for Hillary Clinton.

Mainstream media never covered Hillarys massive hacking or coughing attack yet it is #1 trending. Whats up?

Message for undecided voters: Please wake up and vote DonaldTrump now! Trump/Pence very important save our America before too late!

Thank you! #AmericaFirst 

As a tribute to the late great Phyllis Schlafly I hope everybody can go out and get her latest book THE CONSERVATIVE CASE FOR TRUMP.

China wouldn't provide a red carpet stairway from Air Force One and then Philippines President calls Obama "the son of a whore." Terrible!

The truly great Phyllis Schlafly who honored me with her strong endorsement for president has passed away at 92. She was very special!

Thank you Ohio! #AmericaFirst

President Obama & Putin fail to reach deal on Syria - so what else is new? Obama is not a natural deal maker. Only makes bad deals!

We need to show Americans that Hillary will KILL our Country !! Vote for Trump !!

It defies belief the Web of Lies Hillary is spinning! One excuse after another. Then it's this then it's that.

Lyin' Hillary Clinton told the FBI that she did not know the "C" markings on documents stood for CLASSIFIED. How can this be happening?

To the African-American community: The Democrats have failed you for fifty years high crime poor schools no jobs. I will fix it VOTE "T

The polls are close so Crooked Hillary is getting out of bed and will campaign tomorrow.Why did she hammer 13 devices and acid-wash e-mails?

The Great State of Arizona where I just had a massive rally (amazing people) has a very weak and ineffective Senator Jeff Flake. Sad!

The Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders not weak people such as @JeffFlake if it is going to stop illegal immigration.

Doesn't fit the media narrative - so they wont share what I did for Jesse Jackson in 1999 - so I will!

CNN is so biased. Never ever watch them. Trump 2016!!

Crooked Hillary's V.P. pick said this morning that I was not aware that Russia took over Crimea. A total lie - and taken over during O term!

Wow the failing New York Times has not reported properly on Crooked's FBI release. They are at the back of the pack - no longer a credible source

CNN is so disgusting in their bias but they are having a hard time promoting Crooked Hillary in light of the new e-mail scandals.

Great visit to Detroit church fantastic reception and all @CNN talks about is a small protest outside. Inside a large and wonderful crowd!

Hillary Clinton didn't go to Louisiana and now she didn't go to Mexico. She doesn't have the drive or stamina to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Now that African-Americans are seeing what a bad job Hillary type policy and management has done to the inner-cities they want TRUMP!

Crooked Hillary's brainpower is highly overrated.Probably why her decision making is so bad or as stated by Bernie S she has BAD JUDGEMENT

Does anyone know that Crooked Hillary who tried so hard was unable to pass the Bar Exams in Washington D.C. She was forced to go elsewhere

I know of NO ONE voting for Crooked Hillary! Her rallies are held in theatre & she still has room.

Hillary Clinton Deleted Emails Using Program Intended To Prevent Recovery" #CrookedHillary 

How quickly people forget that Crooked Hillary called African-American youth "SUPER PREDATORS" - Has she apologized?

I am very proud to have brought the subject of illegal immigration back into the discussion. Such a big problem for our country-I will solve

Wonderful Pastor Mark Burns was attacked viciously and unfairly on MSNBC by crazy morning mika on low ratings Morning Joe. Apologize!

What do African-Americans and Hispanics have to lose by going with me. Look at the poverty crime and educational statistics. I will fix it!

Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to solve the problems of poverty education and safety within the African-American & Hispanic communities.

CLINTON CORRUPTION AND HER SABOTAGE OF THE INNER CITIES.  Full speech transcript: 

Hillary Clinton only knows how to make a speech when it is a hit on me. No policy and always very short (stamina). Media gives her a pass!

HRC is using the oldest play in the Dem playbook- when their policies fail they are left w/this one tired argument! 

Hillary Clinton is using race-baiting to try to get African-American voters- but they know she is all talk and NO ACTION!

Hillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society. She should be ashamed of herself!

Just watched recap of #CrookedHillary's speech. Very short and lies. She is the only one fear-mongering!

So many in the African-American community are doing so badly poverty and crime way up employment and jobs way down: I will fix it promise

Just as we won the Cold War in part by exposing the evils of communism and the virtues of free markets.... Cont: 

This is my pledge to the American people: 

It's just a 2-point race Clinton 38% Trump 36%' 

Another health insurer is pulling back due to 'persistent financial losses on #Obamacare plans.' Only the beginning! 

#AmericasMerkel 

CLINTON REFUGEE PLAN COULD BRING IN 620000 REFUGEES IN FIRST TERM AT LIFETIME COST OF OVER $400 BILLION." 

#MakeAmericaSafeAgain  

Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad!

Stay on message" is the chant. I always do - trade jobs military vets 2nd A repeal Ocare borders etc - but media misrepresents!

I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!

It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!

I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!

My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.

If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say I would be beating Hillary by 20%

The failing New York Times which never spoke to me keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False I am who I am-never said

The failing New York Times talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary!

You are a man for the people because you know what it is like to be among the people #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #USA Loves U" Thanks

We're all enjoying you as well Mr. T.! You've inspired Hope and a Positive Spirit throughout America! God bless you!" Nice

Yes you are my hero I admire you for laying down your glorious luxurious life to get beat up for America!!!

We now have confirmation as to one reason Crooked H wanted to be sure that nobody saw her e-mails - PAY-FOR-PLAY. How can she run for Pres.

PAY-FOR-PLAY

I am truly enjoying myself while running for president. The people of our country are amazing - great numbers on November 8th!

The failing New York Times has become a newspaper of fiction. Their stories about me always quote non-existent unnamed sources. Very dishonest!

Will be on Sean Hannity tonight at 10pm hosted by @GovMikeHuckabee. Enjoy!

Thank you Erie Pennsylvania! Together we will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 

Unbelievable support in Florida last night - thank you! #MAGA 

ISIS gained tremendous strength during Hillary Clinton's term as Secretary of State. When will the dishonest media report the facts!

I love watching these poor pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out. They can't!

They can't! They can't!

They can't!

They can't!

A massive tax increase will be necessary to fund Crooked Hillary Clinton's agenda. What a terrible (and boring) rollout that was yesterday!

hank you for coming to Pennsylvania today.

Ratings challenged CNN reports so seriously that I call President Obama (and Clinton) "the founder" of ISIS & MVP. THEY DON'T GET SARCASM?

The founder of ISIS!

The founder of ISIS!

The founder of ISIS!

The founder of ISIS!

The founder of ISIS!

"People gotta stop believing media lies about Trump." That would indeed be nice!

This is no surprise. Constant phony reporting from failing @CNN turns everyone off. The American people get it! 

Thank you Fort Lauderdale Florida.  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

Great job today by the NYPD in protecting the people and saving the climber.

Reuters just announced that Secret Service never spoke to me or my campaign. Made up story by CNN is a hoax. Totally dishonest.

Really admire your determination: Working so hard for all Americans andn daily having to defend yourself from a biased Media.

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 

Thank you!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  

No such meeting or conversation ever happened - a made up story by "low ratings" CNN.

Great meeting w/ coal miners & leaders from the Virginia coal industry- thank you! #MAGA 

I will be interviewed on Greta. Enjoy! 

My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers shot in Sebastian County Arkansas. #LESM

Morning Joe's weakness is its low ratings. I don't watch anymore but I heard he went wild against Rudy Giuliani and #2A - sad & irrelevant!

You were fantastic in defending both the Second Amendment and me last night on CNN. Don Lemon is a lightweight - dumb as a rock

Dumb as a rock.

Dumb as a rock.

Dumb as a rock.

Dumb as a rock.

Now cut off my mic! Bongino refuses to be bullied by Don Lemon over Trump 2nd Amendment  HEATED! 

Media desperate to distract from Clinton's anti-2A stance. I said pro-2A citizens must organize and get out vote to save our Constitution!

When is the media going to talk about Hillary's policies that have gotten people killed like Libya open borders and maybe her emails?

Thank you SenatorChuck Grassley! #TrumpPence16

Michael Morell the lightweight former Acting Director of C.I.A. and a man who has made serious bad calls is a total Clinton flunky!

'Donald Trump Is the middle-class growth candidate' 

I am not just running against Crooked Hillary Clinton I am running against the very dishonest and totally biased media - but I will win!

#CrookedHillary is not fit to be our next president! #TrumpPence16  

Heading to New Hampshire - will be talking about Hillary saying her brain SHORT CIRCUITED and other things!

Anybody whose mind "SHORT CIRCUITS" is not fit to be our president! Look up the word "BRAINWASHED.

Crooked Hillary said loudly and for the world to see that she "SHORT CIRCUITED" when answering a question on her e-mails. Very dangerous!

Hillary Clinton is being badly criticized for her poor performance in answering questions. Let us all see what happens!

Good luck #TeamUSA #OpeningCeremony #Rio2016 

Trump is right about violent crime: Its on the rise in major cities'

DRUDGE_REPORT: FORMER HOSTAGE SAYS PLANE WAITED UNTIL MONEY ARRIVED. 

DRUDGE_REPORT: 'Win-lose deal that benefits Iran and hurts United States'. 

Hillary Clinton has bad judgment and is unfit to serve as President. 

The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva Switzerland not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!

President Obama refuses to answer question about Iran terror funding.  I won't dodge questions as your President. 

Obama's disastrous judgment gave us ISIS rise of Iran and the worst economic numbers since the Great Depression!

President Obama should ask the DNC about how they rigged the election against Bernie.

See you tomorrow w/ Gov. Mike Pence Iowa & Wisconsin!  3pm-

Vast numbers of manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania have moved to Mexico and other countries. That will end when I win!

Thanks to @pnehlen for your kind words very much appreciated.

Join me in Florida on Wednesday! Daytona & Jacksonville.

During the GOP convention CNN cut away from the victims of illegal immigrant violence. They dont want them heard. 

When will CNN do a segment on Hillarys plan to increase Syrian refugees 550% and how much it will cost?

Hillary Clinton raked in money from regimes that horribly oppress women and gays & refuses to speak out against Radical Islam.

Hillary whose decisions have led to the deaths of many accepted $ from a business linked to ISIS. Silence at CNN. 

Crooked Hillary Clinton is 100% owned by her donors. #ImWithYou #MAGA 

Thank you Columbus Ohio! I will be back soon. #ImWithYou #MAGA 

Thank you Oklahoma & Virginia!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #ImWithYou 

People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillary....that's really saying something!

The people who support Hillary sit behind CNN anchor chairs or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life.

Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary?

When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary's pay-for-play at State Department?

CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime failing schools and vanishing jobs.

CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton.

Join Governor Mike Pence in Reno Nevada- tonight at 7pm! Tickets available at: 

#CrookedHillary  

So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine they have already taken Crimea and continue to push. That's what I said!

When I said in an interview that Putin is "not going into Ukraine you can mark it down I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea!

This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!

Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice!

Wow, it is unbelievable how distorted, one-sided and biased the media is against us. The failing New York Times is a joke. CNN is laughable!

Without absolutely OWNING the liberal media, HillaryClinton wouldn't stand a chance. #VoterFraud and mainstream media her only hope.

The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H?

I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!

Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our ""leaders"" to eradicate it!

Nielson Media Research final numbers on ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: TRUMP  32.2 MILLION.  CLINTON 27.8 MILLION.  Thank you!

Thank you to all of the television viewers that made my speech at the Republican National Convention #1 over Crooked Hillary and DEMS.

Can you imagine if I had the small crowds that Hillary is drawing today in Pennsylvania. It would be a major media event! CNN FoxNews

NATO commander agrees members should pay up!

NATO commander agrees members should pay up!

NATO commander agrees members should pay up!

Wow, NATO's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must PAY THEIR BILLS. This is a general I will like!

The ""Rust Belt"" was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico. END!

Crooked's stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 - with Bill, VP

#CrookedHillary = Obama's third term, which would be terrible news for our economic growth - seen below. 

Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?

I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!

Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two ""Big Thursdays"" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings

#CrookedHillary 

Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster!

Violent crime is rising across the United States, yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities.

Just got back from Colorado. The love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible. Big crowds!

While I am in OH & PA - you can also join Mike Pence in Nevada on Mon!  
 
American homeownership rate in Q2 2016 was 62.9% - lowest rate in 51yrs. WE will bring back the  'American Dream!' 

'American Dream!'

We are suffering through the worst long-term unemployment in the last 70 years. I want change - Crooked Hillary Clinton does not.

Hillary can never win over Bernie supporters. Her foreign wars,  NAFTA/TPP support & Wall Street ties are driving away millions of votes.

Colorado was amazing yesterday! So much support. Our tax, trade and energy reforms will bring great jobs to Colorado and the whole country.

ONLY TRUMP CAN UNITE AMERICA AND FIX OBAMA'S MISTAKES!!!

As usual, Hillary & the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games. Same as last time w/ Bernie. Unacceptable!

#CrookedHillary Job Application 

Hillary Clinton should not be given national security briefings in that she is a lose cannon with extraordinarily bad judgement & insticts.

Thank you to the amazing law enforcement officers in Colorado! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #LESM 

Only a Reagan or a Trump-like figure in the White House will achieve this goal."" 

Even Bill is tired of the lies, SAD! 
 
What Bernie Sanders really thinks of Crooked Hillary Clinton. 

I am watching Crooked Hillary speak. Same old stuff, our country needs change!

Wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary. She sold them out, V.P. pick!

In Hillary Clinton's America - things get worse. #TrumpPence16 

The dishonest media didn't mention that Bernie Sanders was very angry looking during Crooked's speech. He wishes he didn't make that deal!

Crooked Hillary said that I ""couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign."" Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her!

If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York, he wouldn't get 10% of the vote - they would run him out of town!  #NeverHillary

Little"" Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster!

General John Allen, who I never met but spoke against me last night, failed badly in his fight against ISIS. His record = BAD  #NeverHillary

Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech. Many of her statements were lies and fabrications!

Mike Pence!! SAD!

Mike Pence!! SAD!

Mike Pence!!

I believe in science" is Dem code for "we're shutting down coal mines, steel plants and any other remaining manufacturing

Ann Coulter is very smart! SAD!

Ann Coulter is very smart!

Ann Coulter is very smart! SAD!

Two policemen just shot in San Diego, one dead. It is only getting worse. People want LAW AND ORDER!

Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and ""forgot"" to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream! SAD!

The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. CNN and the little watched Morning Joe = SAD!

No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes. SAD!

Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world. SAD!

Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety. SAD!

Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street!

Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words. SAD!

Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country. SAD!

Departing now - thank you Cedar Rapids, Iowa. This is a MOVEMENT! 

#CrookedHillary 

Great to be back in Iowa! TBT with Jerry Jr Falwell joining me in Davenport- this past winter. #MAGA 

Median household income is down for the middle class since Obama took office. It will only go further down under Clinton. SAD!

A vote for Clinton-Kaine is a vote for TPP, NAFTA, high taxes, radical regulation, and massive influx of refugees. SAD!

Bernie caved! SAD!

Donald Trump Sees 17-Point Positive Swing in Two Weeks

Trump makes a funny, obvious joke about Russia going after Hillary's emails & U.S. media goes insane with fury. SAD!

Obama Refers to Himself 119 Times During Hillary Nominating Speech... 

President Obama spoke last night about a world that doesnt exist. 70% of the people think our country is going in the wrong direction. #DNC

My message is resonating with the PEOPLE

Barack is offended that I will demand that #NATO allies pay their fair share. #DemsInPhilly

Barack is offended that I will demand that #NATO allies pay their fair share. #DemsInPhilly

Our country does not feel 'great already' to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty, violence and despair.

Shooting deaths of police officers up 78% this year. We must restore law and order and protect our great law enforcement officers!

#CrookedHillary 

Thank you to our amazing law enforcement officers! #MAGA 

Trump right: Illegal families crossing border set to double, 51,152 so far"" 

Great new poll - thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton's 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI!

Join our next Vice President, Mike Pence in Wisconsin tonight & Michigan Thursday! 

Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic

Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to ""carpet bomb"" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz!

Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!

Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!

The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!

Funny how the failing New York Times is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said ""Trump is a genius."" America 1st!

As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.

Just like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP.  

Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep?

I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!

No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated!

You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is, and neither does ISIS (a good thing). Please get your facts straight - thanks. 

For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia.

In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy!

Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here.

Bernie's exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed!

The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!

Thank you New Hampshire!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Pocahontas bombed last night! Sad to watch.

Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great

Funny, if you listen to Fox News, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference

Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.

Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!

Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.

If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.

I was at Fox News and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!

Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke!

While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.

Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War.

Thank you OHIO! #TrumpPence16

Great POLL numbers are coming out all over. People don't want another four years of Obama, and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGA

The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!

Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!

Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!

Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her ""servant"" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie.

If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.

Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!

How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!

The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me

Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing!

The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!

The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!

The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!

Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!

Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out

If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild

The CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!

I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!

Today proves what I have always known, that Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz

Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!

There is no longer a Bernie Sanders ""political revolution."" He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!

An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.

Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!

Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!

Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT

The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!

Kaine supported the stupidest deal in the history of deals 

Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart!

The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud!

Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!

I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!

Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!

Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!

Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.

Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED

Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!

Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!

The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?

General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS! #MakeAmericaSafeAgain

I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.

Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?

Another attack, this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich.

One of the best produced, including the incredible stage & set, in the history of conventions. Great unity! Big T.V. ratings!

Thank you Cleveland. We love you and will be back many times!

What a great four days in Cleveland. So proud of the great job done by the RNC and all. The police and Secret Service were fantastic!

MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN! #RNCinCLE

Thank you Donald J Trump Jr. Proud of you! 

Great job Ivanka Trump! #RNCinCLE 

Other than a small group of people who have suffered massive and embarrassing losses, the party is VERY united. Great love in the arena!

Ted Cruz talks about the Constitution but doesn't say that if the Dems win the Presidency, the new JUSTICES appointed will destroy us all!

I am soooo proud of my children, Don, Eric and Tiffany - their speeches, under enormous pressure, were incredible. Ivanka intros me tonight!

Great job Eric Trump! Proud of you! #AmericaFirst #RNCinCLE 

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Arena was packed, totally electric!

Mike Pence was fantastic tonight. Will be a great V.P.

Our next Vice President of the United States of America, Gov. Mike Pence!

Wow, Ted Cruz got booed off the stage, didn't honor the pledge! I saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway. No big deal!

Great job Eric Trump! Proud of you!  #AmericaFirst #RNCinCLE 

Thank you Scott Walker! #AmericaFirst  #RNCinCLE 

Thank you to Governor Scott Walker for such warm support. Great speech!

Thank you Ingraham!

#AmericaFirst #RNCinCLE  

Watching the #GOPConvention #AmericaFirst #RNCinCLE

John Kasich was never asked by me to be V.P. Just arrived in Cleveland - will be a great two days!

The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails.

Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!

In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs!

Bill Hemmer of FoxNews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. More than in past years.

Congratulations to my children, Don and Tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night. I am very proud of you!

Such a great honor to be the Republican Nominee for President of the United States. I will work hard and never let you down! AMERICA FIRST!

The ROLL CALL is beginning at the Republican National Convention. Very exciting!

Democrats are coming to TRUMP. I used to be proud of the dem party. No more It is crooked and not for the people.

It was truly an honor to introduce my wife, Melania. Her speech and demeanor were absolutely incredible. Very proud! #GOPConvention

Will be on Oreilly Factor tonight at 8:30pm @FoxNews- prior to Melania's speech at the #GOPConvention. Tune in- she will do great!  

Networks other than low ratings @CNN have been very fair and exciting!

CNN is the worst.T hey go to their dumb, one-sided panels when a podium speaker is for Trump! VAST MAJORITY want: Make America Great Again!

Looking forward to being at the convention tonight to watch all of the wonderful speakers including my wife Melania. Place looks beautiful!

President Obama just had a news conference but he doesn't have a clue. Our country is a divided crime scene and it will only get worse!

Our country is totally divided and our enemies are watching. We are not looking good we are not looking smart we are not looking tough!

Bad times for divided USA!

Bad times for divided USA!

Bad times for divided USA!

Bad times for divided USA!

We are TRYING to fight ISIS and now our own people are killing our police. Our country is divided and out of control. The world is watching

We grieve for the officers killed in Baton Rouge today. How many law enforcement and people have to... 

The ratings at Fox News blow away the ratings of CNN - not even close. That's because CNN is the Clinton News Network and people don't like

Fox News is much better and far more truthful than CNN which is all negative. Guests are stacked for Crooked Hillary! I don't watch.

If Goofy Elizabeth Warren a very weak Senator didn't lie about her heritage (being Native American) she would be nothing today. Pick her H

I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas as her V.P. Then we can litigate her fraud!

It doesn't matter that Crooked Hillary has experience look at all of the bad decisions she has made. Bernie said she has bad judgement!

As the days and weeks go by  we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in - Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions!

We are going to have a great time in Cleveland. Will lead to special results for our country. We will Make America Great Again!

Goofy Elizabeth Warren who may be the least productive Senator in the U.S. Senate must prove she is not a fraud. Without the con it's over

Thank you to Jack Morgan Tamara Neo Cheryl Ann Kraft and all of my friends and supporters in Virginia. GREAT JOB!

Great news! We've been nominated for Ireland's Best Golf Hotel 2016. We would appreciate your vote! 

Thank you to Chris Cox and Bikers for Trump - Your support has been amazing. I will never forget. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Thank you! #TrumpPence16 

Crooked Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for by Wall Street lobbyists and special interests. She will sell our country down the tubes!

Very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes Crooked Hillary Clinton can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money!

Crooked Hillary who embarrassed herself and the country with her e-mail lies has been a DISASTER on foreign policy. Look what's happening!

Crooked Hillary is spending big Wall Street money on ads saying I don't have foreign policy experience yet look what her policies have done

Look forward to introducing Governor Mike Pence (who has done a spectacular job in the great State of Indiana). My first choice from start!

Look forward to Governor Mike Pence V.P. introduction tomorrow in New York City.

I am pleased to announce that I have chosen Governor Mike Pence as my Vice Presidential running mate. News conference tomorrow at 11:00 A.M.

Four more years of weakness with a Crooked Hillary Administration is not acceptable. Look what has happened to the world with O & Hillary!

#NeverTrump is never more. They were crushed last night in Cleveland at Rules Committee by a vote of 87-12. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

My prayers and condolences to the victims and families of the terrible tragedy in Nice France. We are with you in every way!

In light of the horrible attack in Nice France I have postponed tomorrow's news conference concerning my Vice Presidential announcement.

Another horrific attack this time in Nice France. Many dead and injured. When will we learn? It is only getting worse.

I employ many people in the State of Virginia - JOBS JOBS JOBS! Crooked Hillary will sell us out just like her husband did with NAFTA.

Another new poll. Thank you for your support! Join the MOVEMENT today!  #ImWithYou 

Great new poll- thank you America! #Trump2016 #ImWithYou 

I will be making the announcement of my Vice Presidential pick on Friday at 11am in Manhattan. Details to follow.

If I win the Presidency we will swamp Justice Ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions!

Even the NYTimes and Washington Post Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach. What was she thinking?

Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge!

On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party. I am spending a lot myself and also helping others.

Voters understand that Crooked Hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity.

Despite spending $500k a day on TV ads alone #CrookedHillary falls flat in nationwide Quinnipiac Poll. Having ZERO impact. Sad!!

Despite spending $500k a day on TV ads alone #CrookedHillary falls flat in nationwide Quinnipiac Poll. Having ZERO impact. Sad!!

Sad!!

Sad!!

Lyin' Crooked Hillary's email stories all have one thing in common. 

Is President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves? Think about it and let me know!

The Republican platform is most  pro-Israel of all time!

New GOP platform now includes language that supports the border wall. We will build the wall and MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!

#CrookedHillary is outspending me by a combined 31 to 1 in Florida Ohio & Pennsylvania. I haven't started yet! 

Thank you Florida Ohio and Pennsylvania! #CrookedHillary is not qualified. 

Justice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot - resign! 

The American people agree. No free pass for #CrookedHillary! 

To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals & global special interests we welcome you with open arms. People first.

Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton.

Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.

#CrookedHillary is not qualified! 

I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. They are not happy that he is selling out!

Bernie Sanders who has lost most of his leverage has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry!

This election is a choice between law order & safety - or chaos crime & violence. I will make America safe again for everyone. #ImWithYou

For too many years our inner cities have been left behind. I am going to deliver jobs safety and protection for those in need.

Crime is out of control and rapidly getting worse. Look what is going on in Chicago and our inner cities. Not good!

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #ImWithYou 

Senior United States District Judge Robert E. Payne today ruled in favor of Trump campaign delegates who had argued..

Speech on Veterans' Reform: 

Great poll- Florida! Thank you! 

Thoughts and prayers with the victims and their families- along with everyone at the Berrien County Courthouse in St. Joseph Michigan.

Join me in Westfield Indiana- tomorrow night at 7:30pm! #Trump2016  Tickets: 

I heard that the underachieving John King of CNN on Inside Politics was one hour of lies. Happily few people are watching - dead network!

The media is so dishonest. If I make a statement they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish.They think the public is stupid!

President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. He is living in a world of the make believe!

Look what is happening to our country under the WEAK leadership of Obama and people like Crooked Hillary Clinton. We are a divided nation!

New poll - thank you! #Trump2016 

Way to go Serena Williams  - you are a true champion. Proud of you!

MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN! 

Isn't it sad that on a day of national tragedy Hillary Clinton is answering softball questions about her email lies on CNN?

Due to the horrific events taking place in our country I have decided to postpone my speech on economic opportunity- today in Miami.

Last night's horrific execution-style shootings of 12 Dallas law enforcement officers...

Prayers and condolences to all of the families who are so thoroughly devastated by the horrors we are all watching take place in our country

After today Crooked Hillary can officially be called Lyin' Crooked Hillary.

Just leaving D.C. Had great meetings with Republicans in the House and Senate. Very interesting day! These are people who love our country!

Great being in Cincinnati Ohio last night- thank you! Off to Washington D.C. now. #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst 

Where is the outrage for this Disney book? Is this the 'Star of David' also?  Dishonest media! #Frozen 

To all of my twitter followers please contribute whatever you can to the campaign. We must beat Crooked Hillary. 

Convention speaker schedule to be released tomorrow. Let today be devoted to Crooked Hillary and the rigged system under which we live.

I have over seven million hits on social media re Crooked Hillary Clinton. Check it out Sleepy Eyes 

Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd a man with so little touch for politics is at it again. He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C.

Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd a man with so little touch for politics is at it again. He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C.

Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City.

Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center Airport - and destroyed City

I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes now many bankruptcies.

Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch her time will come!

The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges but...

Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest incompetent and of very bad judgement.

Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive highly classified information." Not fit!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT!

I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with "murder." Come November 8 she's out!

Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win

FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem

The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual bad judgment.

It was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday. She has done a fantastic job for the people of Iowa and U.S. Will see her again!

Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace!

Meet the Trumps! Hope you enjoy!

Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?

Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?

With Hillary and Obama the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is "guilty as hell" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33000 missing e-mails?

The only people who are not interested in being the V.P. pick are the people who have not been asked!

I look forward to meeting Joni Ernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!

I look forward to meeting Joni Ernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!

I look forward to meeting Joni Ernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!

Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday. Very impressed great people!

Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday. Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd the end result was solid!

Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff's Star or plain star!

Happy 4th of July! #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst 

Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change!

The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this!

In Bangladesh hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed!

I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!

The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting "go away no pictures.

Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about "grandkids" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?

THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!

THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!

THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!

On Saturday a great man Elie Wiesel passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!

Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged & corrupt!

Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.

Just watched meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd and the entire show is against me.The good news-the people get it!

It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said the system is totally rigged!

It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!


Reminder: last year Clinton pledged she had turned over all work-related email under penalty of perjury  

Thank you! #AmericaFirst 

If I become the next POTUS- they will not be ignoring!  

If I become the next POTUS- they will not be ignoring!  

Crooked Hillary -- Makes History!

The #2A to our Constitution is clear. The right of the people to keep & bear Arms shall not be infringed upon. 

#AmericaFirst #ImWithYou 

The speakers slots at the Republican Convention are totally filled with a long waiting list of those that want to speak - Wednesday release

Just read in the failing New York Times that I was not aware "the event had to be held in Cleveland" - a total lie. These people are sick!

When you can't say it - or see it -- you can't fix it. We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN! #ImWithYou #AmericaFirst 

These crimes won't be happening if I'm elected POTUS. Killer should have never been here. #AmericaFirst  

Yet another terrorist attack today in Israel -- a father shot at by a Palestinian terrorist was killed while: 

Horrible killing of a 13 year old American girl at her home in Israel by a Palestinian terrorist. We must get tough. 

Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton. The system is totally rigged. Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?

Bill Clinton's meeting was a total secret. Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter.

As Bernie Sanders said Hillary Clinton has bad judgement. Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary!

The reason I put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. $50 million loan. I have totally terminated the loan!

The very dishonest NBC News refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign. Done deal!

One of the reasons Hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldn't see how she got rich- selling out America.  

Why would college graduates want Crooked Hillary as their President? She will destroy them!  

The story with Hillary will never change. 

For reasons only they can explain the US Chamber wants to continue our bad trade deals rather than renegotiating and making them better.

Tremendous day in Massachusetts and Maine. Thank you to everyone for making it so special!

As of April this year Hillary had spent $2640000 on her campaign Mr.Trump $550000. Self Funding

ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will. Not capable!

ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will. Not capable!

ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will. Not capable!

Why would the USChamber be upset by the fact that I want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that I want penalties for cheaters?

The US CHAMBER must fight harder for the American worker. China and many others are taking advantage of U.S. with our terrible trade pacts

Iron Mike Tyson was not asked to speak at the Convention though I'm sure he would do a good job if he was. The media makes everything up!

This administration is incapable of keeping our country safe!

We must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the United States.

Yet another terrorist attack this time in Turkey. Will the world ever realize what is going on? So sad.

Hillary Clintons Presidency would be catastrophic for the future of our country. She is ill-fit with bad judgment.

Benghazi is just another Hillary Clinton failure. It just never seems to work the way it's supposed to with Clinton.

Check it out - 2nd video on Lying Crooked Hillary is now online! Watch it here:  

Cancel cable - sick of their bad coverage of you and the fawning over Clinton. Listened to your great speech on YouTube


Cancel cable - sick of their bad coverage of you and the fawning over Clinton. Listened to your great speech on YouTube

Ann Coulter also can't help but notice the stock market's reaction as I was speaking. #UPUPUP

Create jobs!

Maybe If corporations weren't overtaxed they would stay.

CNN is all negative when it comes to me. I don't watch it anymore.

The media is unrelenting. They will only go with and report a story in a negative light. I called Brexit (Hillary was wrong) watch November

Crooked Hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the U.S. Senate goofy Elizabeth Warren who lied on heritage.

Under a Trump presidency America will make brilliant new trade deals!

Hillary read "sigh" off the Teleprompter She's so fake she has to be told how to feel!

Hillary read "sigh" off the Teleprompter She's so fake she has to be told how to feel!

Hillary read "sigh" off the Teleprompter She's so fake she has to be told how to feel!

W know they're fake just like poles during primary. I'm sure I will crush #CrookedHillary in general

The "dirty" poll done by ABC is a disgrace. Even they admit that many more Democrats were polled. Other polls were good.

Crooked Hillary Attacks Foreign Government Donations - While Ignoring Her Own: 

Crooked Hillary Clinton got Brexit wrong. I said LEAVE will win. She has no sense of markets and such bad judgement. Only a question of time

Hillary Clinton is not a change agent just the same old status quo! She is spending a fortune I am spending very little. Close in polls!

People in our country want borders and without them the old line pols like Crooked Hillary will not win. It is time for CHANGE -- and JOBS!

Top 50 Facts About Crooked Hillary Clinton From Trump 'Stakes Of The Election' Address: 

The ABC poll sample is heavy on Democrats.  Very dishonest - why would they do that? Other polls good!

Crooked Hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at Turnberry. Shows me hitting shot but I never did = lie! Was there to support son

Clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on BREXIT with big dollar ads. Disgraceful!

Crooked Hillary Clinton who called BREXIT 100% wrong (along with Obama) is now spending Wall Street money on an ad on my correct call.

George Will one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago) has left the Republican Party.He's made many bad calls

Just landed in New York - a one night stay in Scotland. Turnberry came out magnificently. My son Eric did a great job - under budget!

Obama has blocked ICE officers and BP from doing their jobs. That ends when I am President!

I have never liked the media term 'mass deportation' -- but we must enforce the laws of the land!

We only want to admit those who love our people and support our values. #AmericaFirst

We must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place.

So funny Crooked Hillary called BREXIT so incorrectly and now she says that she is the one to deal with the U.K. All talk no action!

Thoughts and prayers are with everyone in West Virginia- dealing with the devastating floods. #ImWithYou

And we will get it back once we have President Trump! Can't wait!

What has happened in the UK in the last 12 hours is exactly what will happen in November..vote TRUMP 2016

Many people are equating BREXIT and what is going on in Great Britain with what is happening in the U.S. People want their country back!

The opening of Trump Turnberry in Scotland was a big success. Good timing I was here for BREXIT. Very exciting news conference today!

Crooked Hillary called it totally wrong on BREXIT - she went with Obama - and now she is saying we need her to lead. She would be a disaster

I want all Americans to succeed together. President Obama's illegal executive amnesty undermines job prospects for...

New Government data by the Center for Immigration Studies shows more than 3M new legal & illegal immigrants settled..

America is proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder w/a free & ind UK. We stand together as friends as allies & as a people w/a shared history.

Self-determination is the sacred right of all free people's and the people of the UK have exercised that right for all the world to see.

Getting ready to open the magnificent Turnberry in Scotland. What a great day especially when added to the brave & brilliant vote.

Statement Regarding British Referendum on E.U. Membership 

Just arrived in Scotland. Place is going wild over the vote. They took their country back just like we will take America back. No games!

Congratulations to my son Eric on the fantastic job he has done in rebuilding Turnberry and its great Ailsa Course. Always support kids!

Leaving now for a one night trip to Scotland in order to be at the Grand Opening of my great Turnberry Resort. Will be back on Sat. night!

Meet the amazing mother whose letter I read during my speech. She lost her son to policies supported by Clinton. 

Read my full statement here on the Supreme Court's executive amnesty decision #imwithyou  

Here is another CNN lie. The Clinton News Network is losing all credibility. Im not watching it much anymore.  

CNN which is totally biased in favor of Clinton should apologize. They knew they were wrong.  

Trump's speech today is the best persuasion I have ever seen. Game over. 

Our inner cities have been left behind. We will never have the resources to support our people if we have an open border.

On immigration Im consulting with our immigration officers & our wage-earners. Hillary Clinton is consulting with Wall Street.

Obama & Clinton should stop meeting with special interests & start meeting with the victims of illegal immigration.

Hillary Clintons open borders are tearing American families apart. I am going to make our country Safe Again for all Americans. #Imwithyou

SC has kept us safe from exec amnesty--for now. But Hillary has pledged to expand it taking jobs from Hispanic & African-American workers.

I was so impressed by my speech yesterday. He was the best I've ever seen him." 

Hillary Lies to Benghazi Families #CrookedHillary  

ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama."  --  Donald J. Trump

Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency."  --   Donald J. Trump

Thank you to Donald Rumsfeld for the endorsement. Very much appreciated. Clinton's conduct has been "disqualifying.

You have great children future presidents...and we all see were raised right and out there for their father." Thank you.

Hillary says things can't change. I say they have to change. It's a choice between Americanism and her corrupt globalism. #Imwithyou

Crooked Hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief! She will be a disaster for jobs and the economy!

I will be interviewed by Lou Dobbs

Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State. She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich! Corrupt dangerous dishonest.

If you want to know about Hillary Clinton's honesty & judgment ask the family of Ambassador Stevens.

Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays.

I am "the king of debt."That has been great for me as a businessman but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt will fix U.S.

Obama-Clinton inherited $10T in debt and turned it into nearly $20T.  They have bankrupted 

Hillary Clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans - and make everyone less safe.

How can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk?

Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as Secretary of State costing Americans millions of jobs.

Hillary says this election is about judgment.  She's right.  Her judgement has killed thousands unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy.

I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton.

Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our president-really bad judgement and a temperament according to new book which is a mess!

When I said that if within the Orlando club you had some people with guns I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees

We are so proud of you Dustin. Your reaction under pressure was amazing. First of many Majors. You are a true CHAMPION!

Yesterday's failing NYTimes fraudulently shows an empty room prior to my speech when in fact it was packed! 

How can the NY Times show an empty room hours before my speech even started when they knew it was going to be packed? So totally dishonest!

My Speech Is a Game Changer.

Thank you Dallas PD!

Thank you Atlanta Georgia! Will be back soon! #AmericaFirst 

I will be meeting with the NRA who has endorsed me about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list or the no fly list to buy guns.

The press is so totally biased that we have no choice but to take our tough but fair and smart message directly to the people!

An: Media fell all over themselves criticizing what DonaldTrump "may have insinuated about POTUS." But he's right: 

HAPPY 241st BIRTHDAY to the @USArmy! THANK YOU! 

Thank you to the LGBT community! I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs.

AMERICA FIRST!

American must now get very tough very smart and very vigilant. We cannot admit people into our country without extraordinary screening.

Join me in Atlanta on Wednesday- at noon! #Trump2016 Tickets: 

Crooked Hillary says we must call on Saudi Arabia and other countries to stop funding hate. I am calling on- cont'd: 

Saudi Arabia and many of the countries that gave vast amounts of money to the Clinton Foundation- cont'd: 

I thought people werent celebrating? They were cheering all over even this savage from Orlando. I was right. 

In my speech on protecting America I spoke about a temporary ban which includes suspending immigration from nations tied to Islamic terror.

Based on the incredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting of the record setting Trump campaign we are hereby:  

I am no fan of President Obama but to show you how dishonest the phony Washington Post is: 

Anyone who plans to talk about Trump ever again has to see this speech.  Your opinion is irrelevant unless you listened

TERRORISM IMMIGRATION AND NATIONAL SECURITY SPEECH- TRANSCRIPT: 

I am watching FoxNews and how fairly they are treating me and my words and CNN and the total distortion of my words and what I am saying

I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror. Hillary just broke-said she would now use!

What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough

Please make us safe. We cannot have Hillary as president. We will be in so much trouble.

Reporting that Orlando killer shouted "Allah hu Akbar!" as he slaughtered clubgoers. 2nd man arrested in LA with rifles near Gay parade.

Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace!

Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism I don't want congrats I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!

Horrific incident in FL. Praying for all the victims & their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough smart & vigilant?

Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame!

Really bad shooting in Orlando. Police investigating possible terrorism. Many people dead and wounded.

Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas pretended to be a Native American in order to advance her career. Very racist!

Riley Rone was a great young man. We will miss him dearly. 

Thank you to our amazing law enforcement officers! #AmericaFirst 

Thank you Tampa Florida! #AmericaFirst #TrumpTrain 

Sad case- USATODAY did article saying I don't pay bills- false only don't pay when work is shoddy bad or not done! They should do same!

In Tampa Florida- thank you to all of our outstanding volunteers who want to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 

Don King and so many other African Americans who know me well and endorsed me would not have done so if they thought I was a racist!

Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist-but I am least racist person there is

Thank you FaithandFreedom Coalition! An honor joining you today- to discuss our shared values. #RTM2016 #Trump2016

Pocahontas is at it again! Goofy Elizabeth Warren one of the least productive U.S. Senators has a nasty mouth. Hope she is V.P. choice.

Trump's Historic 13 Million Primary Votes.

How long did it take your staff of 823 people to think that up--and where are your 33000 emails that you deleted? 

A message of condolences and support regarding the terrorist attacks in Tel Aviv:  

Obama just endorsed Crooked Hillary. He wants four more years of Obamabut nobody else does!

Crooked Hillary Clinton will be a disaster on jobs the economy trade healthcare the military guns and just about all else. Obama plus!

As expected the media is very much against me. Their dishonesty is amazing but just like our big wins in the primaries we will win!

Bernie Sanders must really dislike Crooked Hillary after the way she played him. Many of his supporters because of trade will come to me.

I would have had many millions of votes more than Crooked Hillary Clinton except for the fact that I had 16 opponents she had one!

Senator Sanders spent more than me yet lost.

THE PEOPLE NEED TRUMP2 make USA RICH!

Number one presidency of all time

Top RINO hack for MSNBC Joey Scarborough on the air and calling the next President Trump a racist and bigot. Shame on you

Nobody is watching Morning Joe anymore. Gone off the deep end - bad ratings. You won't believe what I am watching now!

Vote for me at least you'll have a job.

Thank you to all for your wonderful comments on my speech. I could feel the electricity in thr air. Great reviews - most votes ever recieved

In just out book Secret Service Agent Gary Byrne doesn't believe that Crooked Hillary has the temperament or integrity to be the president!

A former Secret Service Agent for President Clinton excoriates Crooked Hillary describing her as ERRATIC & VIOLENT. Bad temperament for pres

See when I said NATO was obsolete because of no terrorism protection they made the change without giving me credit.

My next project is pretty amazing!

Remembering the fallen heroes on DDay. 

I am getting bad marks from certain pundits because I have a small campaign staff. But small is good flexible save money and number one!

A massive blow to Obama's message - only 38000 new jobs for month in just issued jobs report. That's REALLY bad!

Crooked Hillary is being badly criticized (for a Wall Street paid for ad) by PolitiFact for a false ad on me on women. She is a total fraud!

Crooked Hillary Clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months. Her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions!

Just like I have been able to spend far less money than  others on the campaign and finish #1 so too should our country. We can be great!

People at NBC report on my campaign but have zero access. They say what they want without any knowledge.True of so much of media!

Hillary Clinton is unfit to be president. She has bad judgement poor leadership skills and a very bad and destructive track record. Change!

I am watching CNN very little lately because they are so biased against me. Shows are predictable garbage! CNN and MSM is one big lie!

The Clinton News Network sometimes referred to as @CNN is getting more and more biased.They act so indignant-hear them behind closed doors

Our ineffective POTUS has to make a speech in Elkhart to make everything look great.n

Thank you Attorney General Gonzales so many people feel this way.  

We just had the worst jobs report since 2010.

The Mayor of San Jose did a terrible job of ordering the  protection of innocent people. The thugs were lucky supporters remained peaceful!

Many of the thugs that attacked the peaceful Trump supporters in San Jose were illegals. They burned the American flag and laughed at police.

Heres The HILLARY UNIVERSITY Scandal No One In The Media Is Talking About 

Muhammad Ali is dead at 74! A truly great champion and a wonderful guy. He will be missed by all!

Great evening in San Jose other than the thugs. My supporters are far tougher if they want to be but fortunately they are not hostile.

So much interest in my visit to Scotland! I greatly look forward to attending the opening event @TrumpTurnberry- taking place on June 24th.

I'm a former chief of police in a border town. I'm Hispanic I'm proud to be Hispanic and I'm 100% behind Trump." 

In Crooked Hillary's telepromter speech yesterday she made up things that I said or believe but have no basis in fact. Not honest!

I don't watch or do @Morning_Joe anymore. Small audience low ratings! I hear Mika has gone wild with hate. Joe is Joe. They lost their way!

Rally last night in San Jose was great. Tremendous love and enthusiasm in the hall. Big crowd. Outside small group of thugs burned Am flag!

Terrible jobs report just reported. Only 38000 jobs added. Bombshell!

I think the first female president of the USA will be Ivanka Trump a beautiful intelligent young genuine successful lady!

I think the first female president of the USA will be Ivanka Trump a beautiful intelligent young genuine successful lady!

I think the first female president of the USA will be Ivanka Trump a beautiful intelligent young genuine successful lady!

Clinton says I'm dangerous. Who's the one who killed 4 Americans in Benghazi?  

Looks like several legal Hispanics supporting Trump! They know he will be good for them too.

Back to the USA to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

After Scotland I will visit @rumpDoonbeg in Ireland the magnificent resort fronting on the Atlantic Ocean.

Beautiful article about me written by my friend the incredibly talented golfer Natalie Gulbis. 

Only Trump can save America. Right leader at the right time. THANK YOU!

She's a criminal and I'm the only person that can stop her.

THIS IS @POTUS'S LEGACY! AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER!!! WE NEED to MAGA now! 

A vote for Trump is a vote to restore our great country.

A 60% increase in Texas Blue Cross/Blue Shield through ObamaCare. I told you so there is panic and anger as healthcare costs explode!

So great to have the endorsement and support of Paul Ryan. We will both be working very hard to Make America Great Again!

Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton! Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn't even look presidential!

Crooked Hillary no longer has credibility - too much failure in office. People will not allow another four years of incompetence!

Crooked Hillary Clinton who I would love to call Lyin' Hillary is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions.

After the litigation is disposed of and the case won I have instructed my execs to open Trump U(?) so much interest in it! I will be pres.

Even though I have a very biased and unfair judge in the Trump U civil case in San Diego I have thousands of great reviews & will win case!

With all of the Crooked Hillary Clinton's foreign policy experience she has made so many mistakes - and I mean real monsters! No more HRC.

Join me in San Jose California- tonight! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 Tickets: 

Wow USA Today did todays cover story on my record in lawsuits. Verdict: 450 wins 38 losses. Isn't that what you want for your president?

Do you ever notice that CNN gives me very little proper representation on my policies. Just watched-nobody knew anything about my foreign P

Bernie Sanders was right when he said that Crooked Hillary Clinton was not qualified to be president because she suffers from BAD judgement!

Crooked Hillary Clinton has zero natural talent - she should not be president. Her temperament is bad and her decision making ability-zilch!

Same failing New York Times "reporter" who wrote discredited women's story last week wrote another terrible story on me today- will never learn!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is a fraud who has put the public and country at risk by her illegal and very stupid use of e-mails. Many missing!

So I raised/gave $5600000 for the veterans and the media makes me look bad! They do anything to belittle - totally biased.

Congratulations to Sean Hannity on his tremendous increase in television ratings. Speaking of ratings- I will be on his show tonight

I am getting great credit for my press conference today. Crooked Hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days.

Katie Couric the third rate reporter who has been largely forgotten should be ashamed of herself for the fraudulent editing of her doc.

So many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money I raised/gave! It was my great honor - they do an amazing job.

Just finished a press conference in Trump Tower wherein I gave information on which VETERANS groups got the $5600000 that I raised/gave!

I have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great VETERANS and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so. Watch!

So many great things happening - new poll numbers looking good! News conference at 11:00 A.M. today Trump Tower!

I should have easily won the Trump University case on summary judgement but have a judge Gonzalo Curiel who is totally biased against me.

I have a judge in the Trump University civil case Gonzalo Curiel (San Diego) who is very unfair. An Obama pick. Totally biased-hates Trump

I hope everyone had a great Memorial Day!

I would have had millions of votes more in the primaries (than Crooked Hillary) if I only had one opponent instead of sixteen. Broke record

Have a great Memorial Day and remember that we will soon MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Illegals are taken care of better than our veterans.  

The endorsement of me by the 16500 Border Patrol Agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate. Nice!

In getting the endorsement of the 16500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you) the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary!

Obama says a WALL at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at W.H.

I will build the wall! That I can tell you!

I will build the wall! That I can tell you!

I will build the wall! That I can tell you!

I will build the wall! That I can tell you!

I will build the wall! That I can tell you!

If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent say good bye to the Supreme Court!

The Republican Party has to be smart & strong if it wants to win in November. Can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate!

Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser but if the GOP can't control their own then they are not a party. Be tough R's!

Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics- b/c I stand 100% behind everything we do.

Honor Memorial Day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country! We love them.

Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he's in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost. #MDW

Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me!

I am always on the front page of the failing New York Times but when I won the GOP nomination I'm in the back of the paper. Very dishonest!

The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money & get much better results! What we need as Prez!

The failing New York Times wrote a story about my management style & that I don't have many people. I have 73 Hillary has 800- & I'm beating her.

I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary - by a lot - and with many states left to go! Thank you.

The U.S. has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders. How nice but what do we get? NOT ENOUGH

Obama administration fails to screen Syrian refugees' social media accounts: 

Fantastic job on handling the thugs who tried to disrupt our very peaceful and well attended rally. Greatly appreciated!

Thank you Billy Joel. Many friends just told me you gave a very kind shoutout at MSG. Appreciate it- love your music!

Wow- 25000 in San Diego California! Thank you!!  

AN AMERICA FIRST ENERGY PLAN #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Poll data shows that Marco Rubio does by far the best in holding onto his Senate seat in Florida. Important to keep the MAJORITY. Run Marco!

Today we together won the Republican Nomination for President! 

My wife MELANIA TRUMP and my children will be featured on FoxNews

I find it offensive that Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas pretended to be Native American to get in Harvard.

Thank you Mr. & Mrs. Tom Barrack Jr for the wonderful and magical evening last night. It will not be forgotten.

The Inspector General's report on Crooked Hillary Clinton is a disaster. Such bad judgement and temperament cannot be allowed in the W.H.

Thank you Anaheim California! #Trump2016 

Thank you Washington! Honored to say on behalf of our great movement we have broken the all time record for votes in GOP primary history.

The protesters in New Mexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican flag. The rally inside was big and beautiful but outside criminals!

Crooked Hillary Clinton just can't close the deal with Bernie. I had to knock out 16 very good and smart candidates. Hillary doesn't have it

Goofy Senator Elizabeth Warren @elizabethforma has done less in the U.S. Senate than practically any other senator. All talk no action!

Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes known as Pocahontas bought foreclosed housing and made a quick killing. Total hypocrite!

Great rally in New Mexico amazing crowd! Now in L.A. Big rally in Anaheim.

After raising w/ no obligation almost $6M for Vets I couldn't believe protesters formed @ Trump Tower. JUST OUT- SENT BY CROOKED HILLARY!

I blame the dishonest media.

A wonderfully written article concerning Israel. 

A great new book has been written about Crooked Hillary. Read it & you will never be able to vote for her.

My favorite book is the bible, and second favorite Art of the Deal.

Crooked Hillary Clinton overregulates overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs. Most importantly she suffers from plain old bad judgement!

I just released my financial disclosure forms the largest numbers in the history of the F.E.C. Even the dishonest media thinks great!

Amazingly with all of the money I have raised for the vets I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media.

Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups.

While under no obligation to do so I have raised between 5 & 6 million dollars including 1million dollars from me for our VETERANS. Nice!

Obamas VA Secretary just said we shouldn't measure wait times. Hillary says VA problems are not widespread. I will take care of our vets!

Is Hillary really protecting women? 

In trade military and EVERYTHING else it will be AMERICA FIRST! This will quickly lead to our ultimate goal: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

The American people are sick and tired of not being able to lead normal lives and to constantly be on the lookout for terror and terrorists!

Bernie Sanders is continuing his quest because he believes that Crooked Hillary Clinton will be forced out of the race - e-mail scandal!

Crooked Hillary wants a radical 500% increase in Syrian refugees. We cant allow this. Time to get smart and protect America!

How can Crooked Hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical Islam which horribly oppresses women?

BREAKING POLL: Trump Gains 11 Points on Clinton Since March. Now Leads Crooked Hillary 46-44 

Why do the networks continue to put dopey Bill Kristol on panels when he has called every single shot about me wrong for 2 yrs?

Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad! Would be four more years of stupidity!

Crooked Hillary said that I  want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong!

I WILL do the right thing for the U.S.A without a doubt.

Thank you to all of the men and women who have served our country. You are our true heroes! #ArmedForcesDay 

Crooked Hillary Clintons foreign interventions unleashed ISIS in Syria Iraq and Libya. She is reckless and dangerous!

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

CNN is so negative getting even worse as I get closer. Just had two anti-Trump losers with zero rebuttal from my team. Turning off!

Hillary wants to rip the guns out of America's hands. No guns = no protection. Get on #TrumpTrain & join NRA to stop her.

Crooked Hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed. No more guns to protect Hillary!

While our wonderful president was out playing golf all day the TSA is falling apart just like our government! Airports a total disaster!

Crooked Hillary is spending tremendous amounts of Wall Street money on false ads against me. She is a very dishonest person!

Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment. No gun owner can ever vote for Clinton!

Colin great to have you at Trump Turnberry. So proud of you and your GREAT playing! You made winning MAJORS look easy!

Best Links Course in Britain. Ailsa Course opens June '16 Can't wait to play it 

We will not disappoint!

Great day in Kentucky with Wayne LaPierre and the NRA!  

Failing New York Times will always take a good story about me and make it bad. Every article is unfair and biased. Very sad!

Trump is the most unpredictable extraordinary entertaining & massively popular candidate this country has ever seen.

I am on my way! See you all soon! 

Crooked Hillary can't even close the deal with Bernie - and the Dems have it rigged in favor of Hillary. Four more years of this? No way!

Crooked Hillary Clinton looks presidential? I don't think so! Four more years of Obama and our country will never come back. ISIS LAUGHS!

Look where the world is today a total mess and ISIS is still running around wild. I can fix it fast Hillary has no chance!

Crooked Hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina. ISIS China Russia and all would love for her to be president. 4 more years!

I said that Crooked Hillary Clinton is "not qualified" to be president because she has "very bad judgement" - Bernie said the same thing!

Looks like yet another terrorist attack. Airplane departed from Paris. When will we get tough smart and vigilant? Great hate and sickness!

My list of potential U.S. Supreme Court Justices was very well recieved. During the next number of weeks I may be adding to the list!

Some low-life journalist claims that I "made a pass" at her 29 years ago. Never happened! Like the @nytimes story which has become a joke!

Why did Clinton supporters declare Crooked Hillary winner in KY when AP hasn't even called the race?

Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Democrats - the system is rigged against him. Many of his disenfranchised fans are for me!

Paul Begala the dopey CNN flunky and head of the Pro-Hillary Clinton Super PAC has knowingly committed fraud in his first ad against me.

Trump for President! Bernie is a joke knows nothing - and Hillary is yesterday's and today's nightmare

The Trump movement will not be stopped. We support Trump because he is a true American looking out for #AmericaFIRST.

Congratulations to THE MOVEMENT we have just won THE GREAT STATE OF OREGON. The vote percentage is even higher than anticipated! Thank you.

Hillary Just Handed me a huge Gift. Promising to Put Bubba in Charge of the Economy!

No way I believe Trump at 70% disapproval with women. Went to 3 rallies. At least 1/2 women. MSM Lies! MSM Lies!

Michael Barbaro the author of the now discredited New York Times hit piece on me with women has in past tweeted badly about me. He should resign

He will destroy Hillary but why give CNN record breaking ratings CNN can go to hell. Trump 2016

I look so forward to debating Crooked Hillary Clinton! Democrat Primaries are rigged e-mail investigation is rigged - so time to get it on!

I can't believe that @CNN would allow the very nice Jeffrey Lord to be savaged by a panel of seven Trump haters. 7 to 1 - Don't watch CNN!

I am a pillar of strength and will be perfect as our next president

Well that is it. Well done Megyn --- and they all lived happily ever after! Now let us all see how "THE MOVEMENT" does in Oregon tonight!

Will go back on for a final question now! Amazing job

Great interview! Happy you had a chance to show the other side. Never change never forget you are our messenger!

I like Michael Douglas!

I like Michael Douglas!

I like Michael Douglas!

I like Michael Douglas!

Best interview that I have ever seen.

One thing we know for sure Bernie Sanders supporters will turn to #Trump - absolutely not HillaryClinton

I speak from the heart for all of America. His intention is for a positive future for all. 

Wall Street paid for ad is a fraud just like Crooked Hillary! Their main line had nothing to do with women and they knew it. Apologize?

Do you think Crooked Hillary will finally close the deal? If she can't win Kentucky she should drop out of race. System rigged! 

I look forward to watching Megan Kelly. It will be interesting to see how she treats me. I think she will be very fair.

How can Crooked Hillary put her husband in charge of the economy when he was responsible for NAFTA the worst economic deal in U.S. history?

Crooked Hillary said her husband is going to be in charge of the economy.If so he should runnot her.Will he bring the "energizer" to D.C.?

Crooked Hillary can't close the deal with Bernie Sanders. Will be another bad day for her!

Amazing that Crooked Hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the WORST abuser of woman in U.S. political history

Oregon is voting today. Keep the big numbers going - VOTE TRUMP! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women. Can't believe she would misrepresent the facts! My hit was on China

The pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. "You can tell them to go BLANK themselves" - was about China NOT WOMEN!

Wow 30000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar! How can she run?

Wow 30000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar! How can she run?

Wow 30000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar! How can she run?

What Barbara Res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly and for years trying to come back. I said no.

I gave a woman named Barbara Res a top N.Y. construction job when that was unheard of and now she is nasty. So much for a nice thank you!

In politics and in life ignorance is not a virtue." This is a primary reason that President Obama is the worst president in U.S. history!

The writer of the now proven false story in the New York Times Michael Barbaro who was interviewed on CBS this morning was unable to respond.

Over 50 women were interviewed by the New York Times yet they only wrote about 6. Thats because there were so many positive statements.

No wonder the New York Times is failing who can believe what they write after the false malicious & libelous story they did on me.

The failing New York Times is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women. 

With the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing New York Times hit piece on me we have exposed the article as a fraud!

A political commentator for CNN which I no longer watch said "Trump showed some weakness in the Repub Primaries." I set all-time record!

The New York Times is so dishonest. Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer who said it was a lie!

That was an amazing interview on Fox and Friends - I hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the New York Times is!

Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Dems. The system is rigged against him. He should run as an independent! Run Bernie run.

The Washington Post report on potential VP candidates is wrong. Marco Rubio and most others mentioned are NOT under consideration.

Thank you Georgia! See you soon! #Trump2016 

The media is really on a witch-hunt against me. False reporting and plenty of it - but we will prevail!

Why did the failing New York Times refuse to use any of the names given to them that I was so proud to have helped with their careers. DISHONEST!

Wow I have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing New York Times piece. Massive front page for that!

Why doesn't the failing New York Times write the real story on the Clintons and women? The media is TOTALLY dishonest!

New York Times keep shining....the ppl will not let the media dim your light...we no longer believe them! #Trump2016" Thanks.

Everyone continues to pile onto me but they can NEVER take away our votes!"  Thank you!

Everyone is laughing at the New York Times for the lame hit piece they did on me and women.I gave them many names of women I helped-refused to use

OHIO WOMEN FOR TRUMP 

OHIO WOMEN FOR TRUMP 

OHIO WOMEN FOR TRUMP 

OHIO WOMEN FOR TRUMP 

We seem to have the same trajectory both were written off but they keep scaling the heights. History?

The failing New York Times wrote yet another hit piece on me. All are impressed with how nicely I have treated women they found nothing. A joke!

Wow CNN is really working hard to make me look as bad  as possible. Very unprofessional. Hurting in ratings - bad television! Great new poll- thank you! 

If Crooked Hillary Clinton can't close the deal on Crazy Bernie how is she going to take on China Russia ISIS and all of the others?

An incredible honor to receive the endorsement of a person I have such tremendous respect for. Thank you Sheldon! 

Your story about me & the carbon tax is absolutely incorrect. It is just the opposite. I will not support or endorse a carbon tax!

Senator Lindsey Graham called me yesterday very much to my surprise and we had a very interesting talk about national security and more!

If it were up to goofy Elizabeth Warren wed have no jobs in Americashe doesnt have a clue.

In interview I told AP that my taxes are under routine audit and I would release my tax returns when audit is complete not after election!

Isnt it funny when a failed Senator like goofy Elizabeth Warren can spend a whole day tweeting about Trump & gets nothing done in Senate?

Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage. See mediaasking for increase!

Our Native American Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren couldnt care less about the American workerdoes nothing to help!

Goofy Elizabeth Warren is now using the womans card like her friend crooked Hillary. See her dumb tweet when a woman stands up to you

If the people of Massachusetts found out what an ineffective Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren has been she would lose! Thanks Piers. 

'Duck Dynasty' star Phil Robertson says he'll back Trump for president 

Goofy Elizabeth Warren didnt have the guts to run for POTUS. Her phony Native American heritage stops that and VP cold.

Goofy Elizabeth Warren has been one of the least effective Senators in the entire U.S. Senate. She has done nothing!

I don't want to hit Crazy Bernie Sanders too hard yet because I love watching what he is doing to Crooked Hillary. His time will come!

Big wins in West Virginia and Nebraska. Get ready for November - Crooked Hillary who is looking very bad against Crazy Bernie will lose!

The Clintons spend millions on negative ads on me & I cant tell the truth about her husband? Dont feel sorry for crooked Hillary!

Hillary has bad judgment! 

It was so great being in Nebraska last week. Today is the big day--get out and vote!

I look very much forward to meeting w/Paul Ryan & the GOP Party Leadership on Thurs in DC. Together we will beat the Dems at all levels!

It is only the people that were never asked to be VP that tell the press that they will not take the position.

It was Rosie O'Donnell who ate the cake in the vicious Hillary commercial about me not Crooked Hillary!

Why does the media with a strong push from Crooked Hillary keep pushing the false narrative that I want to raise taxes. Exactly opposite!

Great job on Fox and Friends this morning. Thank you for the nice words!

For Our Children: Let's Elect Donald Trump 

I am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate. Any negotiated increase by Congress to my proposal would still be lower than current!

I will have set the all time record in primary votes in the Republican party --despite having to compete against 17 other people!

If I only had 1 person running against me in the primaries like Hillary Clinton I would have gotten 10 million more votes than she did!

Crooked Hillary Clinton says that she got more primary votes than Donald Trump. But I had 17 people to beatshe had one!  A nasty guy with no heart!

Is Chris serious lying or misinformed? Bill Clinton signed NAFTA. 

The liars that signed the pledge and now won't support me. The reason they are losers. A nasty guy with no heart!

Wow I hear Morning Joe has gone really hostile ever since I said I won't do or watch the show anymore.They misrepresent my positions!

Russell Moore is truly a terrible representative of Evangelicals and all of the good they stand for. A nasty guy with no heart!


Crooked Hillary just can't close the deal with Bernie. It will be the same way with ISIS and China on trade and Mexico at the border. Bad!

Kellyanne you were fantastic on Meet The Press today. Keep going - I will win for the people. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! HappyMothersDay!  

Kellyanne you were fantastic on Meet The Press today. Keep going - I will win for the people. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! HappyMothersDay! 

Kellyanne you were fantastic on Meet The Press today. Keep going - I will win for the people. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! HappyMothersDay! 

I want a leader that will shoot straight with us. The politicians can't.

Remember when the two failed presidential candidates Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush signed a binding PLEDGE? They broke the deal no honor!

I am honored that the great men and women of the @Teamsters have created a movement from within called Teamsters for Trump! Thank you.

I am going to keep our jobs in the U.S. and totally rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. Crooked Hillary has no clue! @Teamsters

Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk no action -- maybe her Native American name?

Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts.

Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me.

Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant but leaves behind amazing legacy.

Goofy Elizabeth Warren Hillary Clintons flunky has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American.

Lets properly check goofy Elizabeth Warrens records to see if she is Native American. I say shes a fraud!

I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.

I hear JoeNBC of rapidly fading Morning_Joe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run. This will guarantee a Crooked Hillary win.

Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed then John Kasich and that didn't work. Not much power or insight!

Thank you to teachers across America! When I become POTUS we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now.

Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability. As Bernie Sanders says she has bad judgement. Constantly playing the women's card - it is sad!

Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special the Republican Party. Wrong I didn't inherit it I won it with millions of voters! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill.

Many would say that you are the only talented person running for the top job this time!

So many great endorsements yesterday except for Paul Ryan! We must put America first and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill.

Governor Rick Perry said "Donald Trump is one of the most talented people running for the Presidency I've ever seen." Thank you Rick!

Unlike crooked Hillary Clinton who wants to destroy all miners I want wages to go up in America. We will do so by bringing back jobs! I love Hispanics! 

Thank you West Virginia. Let's keep it going. Go out and vote on Tuesday - we will win big. #Trump2016

Can you believe Crooked Hillary said "We are going to put a whole lot of coal miners&coal companies out of business." She then apologized. I love Hispanics! 

Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats. Both with delegates & otherwise. He should show them & run as an Independent.

Happy #CincoDeMayo! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! 

I love Hispanics!

I love Hispanics! 

I love Hispanics! 

I will be interviewed by @BretBaier @SpecialReport at 6pm ET tonight @FoxNews

Many reports that I will be attending the Alvarez/Khan fight this weekend in Vegas. Totally untrue! Unfortunately I have other plans.

The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill.

I would rather run against Crooked Hillary Clinton than Bernie Sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against Bernie!

What a great evening we had. So interesting that Sanders beat Crooked Hillary. The dysfunctional system is totally rigged against him!

Please correct I WON Virginia!

Thank you Indiana we were just projected to be the winner. We have won in every category. You are very special people-I will never forget!

Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will and must win Indiana. If he doesn't he should drop out of the race-stop wasting time & money.

Wow Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure - not very presidential. Sad!

I will be campaigning in Indiana all day. Things are looking great and the support of Bobby Knight has been so amazing. Today will be fun!

Everybody is talking about the protesters burning the American flags and proudly waving Mexican flags. I want America First - so do voters!

Gov Mike Pence has just stated that Donald Trump has taken a strong stance on Hoosier jobs and he thanks me! I will bring back jobs to USA.

Crooked Hillary Clinton said she is used to "dealing with men who get off the reservation." Actually she has done poorly with such men!

Karl Rove is a failed Jeb Bushy. Never says anything good & never will even after I beat Hillary. Shouldn't be on the air!

I am on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace- his 20th year anniversary with Fox News! 

I watched Sen. Graham Face The Nation. Why don't they say that I ran him out of the race like a little boy and in the end he had no support? Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will and must win Indiana. If he doesn't he should drop out of the race-stop wasting time & money.

Wow Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure - not very presidential. Sad! 

The economy is bad and getting worse-almost ZERO growth this quarter. Nobody can beat me on the economy (and jobs). MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

The "protesters" in California were thugs and criminals. Many are professionals. They should be dealt with strongly by law enforcement!

Anderson so amazing. Your mother is and always has been an incredible woman!

We are now at 1001 delegates. We will win on the first ballot and are not wasting time and effort on other ballots because system is rigged!

Crooked Hillary Clinton perhaps the most dishonest person to have ever run for the presidency is also one of the all time great enablers!

Wow the ridiculous deal made between Lyin'Ted Cruz and 1 for 42 John Kasich has just blown up. What a dumb deal - dead on arrival!

New York Yankees President Randy Levine: 'End of the Republican Party' If Donald Trump Not Nominated.   

So many false and phony T.V. commercials being broadcast in Indiana. Reminds me of Florida where thousands were put up-I won in a landslide!

I will be in Evansville Indiana with the great Bobby Knight (who last night endorsed me) at 12:00 this afternoon. See you there!

Lyin' Ted Cruz who can never beat Hillary Clinton and has NO path to victory has chosen a V.P.candidate who failed badly in her own effort

Thank you to all for the wonderful reviews of my foreign policy speech. I will soon be speaking in great detail on numerous other topics!

I cried when they said you made a clean sweep of all 5 states. I was SO HAPPY!

Getting the strong endorsement of the great coach Bobby Knight has been a highlight of my stay in Indiana. Big speech tomorrow with Bobby!

I am in Indiana where we just had a great rally. Fantastic people! Staying at a Holiday Inn Express - new and clean not bad! Thank you Laura!  

Thank you for the endorsement Coach Bobby Knight! I will never forget it! Thank you Newt! Thanks Dave! 

GREATEST FOREIGN POLICY SPEECH SINCE WASHINGTON'S FAREWELL ADDRESS.

Lets #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Maryland! #VoteTrump  

How bad is the New York Times the most inaccurate coverage constantly. Always trying to belittle. Paper has lost its way!

Thank you for the incredible support- Melania Barron Ivanka Jared Tiffany Don Vanessa Eric and Lara! 

Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democratsboth with delegates & otherwise. He should show them and run as an Independent! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

The Cruz-Kasich pact is under great strain. This joke of a deal is falling apart not being honored and almost dead. Very dumb!

Passing what was once a vibrant manufacturing area in Pennsylvania. So sad! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  

On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night!

Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work.

Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.

Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!

Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!

Wow just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!

I am happy to hear how badly the New York Times is doing. It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down. Becoming irrelevant!

I will be in Maryland this afternoon for a major rally. Things are looking good for Tuesday!

As soon as John Kasich is hit with negative ads he will drop like a rock in the polls against Crooked Hillary Clinton. I will win!

I had a great day campaigning in Connecticut. Looking for a big vote on Tuesday!

Congratulations to Sean Hannity on his great ratings and ratings increase as reported by the AP today. Amazing job!

Lynne Ryan -- just read your great story in the NY Times -- I am proud of you. Thanks! 

Cast your vote for Trump for POTUS & ALSO vote for the TRUMP DELEGATES in your congressional district! 

Will be spending the day campaigning in Connecticut another state where jobs are being stolen by other countries. I will stop this fast!

I met Prince on numerous occasions. He was an amazing talent and wonderful guy. He will be greatly missed!

Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted.

Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!

Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!

I will be doing the @TODAYshow with my wife Melania and the rest of my family in a major Town Hall. Hopefully it will be fun! Enjoy.7A.M.

We are going to bring steel and manufacturing back to Indiana!

Had a meeting with the terrific @GovPenceIN of Indiana. So excited to campaign in his wonderful state! 

Ted Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race. Now all he can do is be a spoiler never a nice thing to do. I will beat Hillary! 

CNN is so negative it is impossible to watch. Terrible panel angry haters.    

1988 with Oprah, I discuss why I would never rule out a run for POTUS.

Who did the House Task Force on Urgent Fiscal Issues call- when America needed HELP?  

Lyin Ted Cruz even voted against Superstorm Sandy aid and September 11th help. So many New Yorkers devastated. Cruz hates New York!

New York we will make America great again! 

Kasich only looks O.K. in polls against Hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed ZERO negative ads against him

Lyin' Ted Cruz can't win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bosses-I am millions of VOTES ahead! Hillary would destroy him & Kasich

I will fix this corrupted rigged system. 4 no Profit Under budget & ahead of schedule.

I would have millions of votes more than Hillary except for the fact that I had 17 opponents and she just had a socialist named Bernie!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. I am the one person she doesn't want to run against. Will be such fun!

Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses. It won't work!

Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary. Despite a rigged delegate system I am hundreds of delegates ahead of him.

I'll be in one of my favorite places this morning Staten Island. Big crowd will be fun!

New CBS Poll shows defections from Cruz's core supporters & increased support for me. Not surprising.

I'm starting to believe that I'm actually going to WIN!

Just arrived in Syracuse NY. Big crowd great place! We will bring back the desperately needed jobs. #NYPrimary 

We are becoming a third world country because of jerks like him" Great! We are becoming a third world country because of jerks like him" Great!

We are becoming a third world country because of jerks like him" Great! Finally someone who actually cares about us!! 

Big protest march in Colorado on Friday afternoon! Don't let the bosses take your vote!

The rules DID CHANGE in Colorado shortly after I entered the race in June because the pols and their bosses knew I would win with the voters

Biggest story in politics is now happening in the great State of Colorado where over one million people have been precluded from voting!

Missouri just confirmed #Trump2016 as the official winner- with an additional 12 delegates. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

Leaving for Albany New York now massive crowd expected. Very exciting!

Why does the liberal media think Bill O'Reilly is a complete and total vulgarian? I don't think so!

Why does the liberal media think Bill O'Reilly is a complete and total vulgarian? I don't think so!

Colorado Trump Delegates Scratched from Ballots at GOP Convention 

This is happening all over our countrygreat people being disenfranchised by politicians. Repub party is in trouble! 

The people of Colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians. Biggest story in politics. This will not be allowed!

How is it possible that the people of the great State of Colorado never got to vote in the Republican Primary? Great anger - totally unfair!

I win a state in votes and then get non-representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign. Bad system!

The New York Times purposely covers me so inaccurately. I want other nations to pay the U.S. for our defense of them. We are the suckers-no more!

New Jersey Man Joseph Hornick Willing to Go to Jail for Flying Trump Flag

GOP is trying to steal nomination from the winner not block an insurgent catching up 2 frontrunner (Sanders).

I am the only person who can save us from this corrupt political mess. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Women love Mr Trump too. Will make it happen in New York on April 19. Go out & vote.

Bernie Sanders says that Hillary Clinton is unqualified to be president. Based on her decision making ability I can go along with that!

Isn't it a shame that the person who will have by far the most delegates and many millions more votes than anyone else me still must fight

Trump will be our best president since Reagan! Nobody beats me on National Security. Looks like I was right about NATO. I had no doubt. 

Jennifer is a terrific person. Trump Cruz is hated in New York. He should go home - no place for a phony. Ted Cruz attacked New Yorkers and New York values- we don't forget! 

Jennifer is a terrific person. Trump Cruz is hated in New York. He should go home - no place for a phony. Ted Cruz attacked New Yorkers and New York values- we don't forget! 

Unbelievable evening. Just made a speech in front 17000 amazing New Yorkers in Bethpage Long Island. Great to be home! Pure fiction!

It is so great to be back home! Looking forward to a great rally tonight in Bethpage Long Island!

Wow Politico is in total disarray  with almost everybody quitting. Good news. Bad dishonest journalists! 

DonaldTrump is the only guy I think that has the will & the nerve to attack & to fight. 

VERY close to my heart. I'm a NAVY VET! I love VETERANS ADMINISTRATION REFORMS. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Wow great news from Wisconsin. Just made two speeches there with a big one coming tonight. Thank you! 

A great day in Wisconsin many stops many great people! Melania is joining me on Monday. Big crowds. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I don't care about the game I care about the PEOPLE. And that's exactly why WE THE PEOPLE love you so much! #Trump2016

CNN is reviewing the weekbut majority of the show about me because there would be 0.0 ratings if not. Media's a JOKE. Enjoy!

Thank you for your nice words on Fox today. They never use my full statements on nuclear which you would agree with!

Great honor to have GOP General Counsel John Ryder as a Trump delegate in TN. RNC meeting well worth it! Unifying the party!

Wisconsin has suffered a great loss of jobs and trade but if I win all of the bad things happening in the U.S. will be rapidly reversed!

I will be in Wisconsin until the election. Jobs trade and immigration will be big factors. I will bring jobs back home - make great deals!

If Megan Kelly stopped covering me on her show her ratings would drop like a rock! My h to h interview with Anderson Cooper beat her by millions! Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? 

Is it possible for Megan Kelly to cover anyone but Donald Trump on her terrible show. She totally misrepresents my words and positions! BAD. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! BAD.

Can you believe that Ted Cruz who has been killing our country on trade for so long just put out a Wisconsin ad talking about trade? We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States! 

We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States!

We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States!

We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States! We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States! Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? 

For the 1st time in American history Americas 16500 border patrol agents have issue a presidential primary endorsementme! Thank you.

The National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) said that our open border is the biggest physical & economic threat facing the American people! Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? 

The Club For Growth said in their ad that 465 delegates (Cruz) plus 143 delegates (Kasich) is more than my 739 delegates. Try again! Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? 

The Club For Growth which asked me for $10000 in an extortion attempt just put up a Wisconsin ad with incorrect math.What a dumb group! Does anybody like Lyin' Ted? 

Just had a very nice meeting with Reince Priebus and the @GOP. Looking forward to bringing the Party together and it will happen! The Trump Doctrine: Peace Through Strength. Nothing you say will change my mind! Congratulations to CNN for having the wisdom to pick TRUMP! 

Nice piece and video today in the Wall Street Journal: Trumps three eldest children jump into campaign 

David Gregory got thrown off of TV by NBC fired like a dog! Now he is on CNN being nasty to me. Not nice!

Final numbers's just announced in the GREAT State of MO. TRUMP WINS! New certified #'s show a 365 vote increase for me- @ least 12 more delegates!

Why is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference? What is in her hand??

This was the reporters statement- when she found out there was tape from my facility she changed her tune. 

Victory press conference was over.  Why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions? Can I press charges? 

Why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened that is before she found out the episode was on tape?

Wow Corey Lewandowski my campaign manager and a very decent man was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there!

How come the @TODAYshow & @chucktodd show the new @NBCNews Poll for Hillary vs Bernie but do not show the SAME poll where I am killing Cruz?

I have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC.

Wow CNN has nothing but my opponents on their shows. Really one-sided and unfair reporting. Maybe I shouldn't do their town-hall tonight!

We need to secure our borders ASAP. No games we must be smart tough and vigilant. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN & MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN!

Lyin' Ted I have already beaten you in all debates and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates. You should focus on jobs & illegal imm!

Lyin'Ted Cruz is weak & losing big so now he wants to debate again. But according to DrudgeTime and on-line polls I have won all debates

After the way I beat Gov. Scott Walker (and Jeb Rand Marco and all others) in the Presidential Primaries no way he would ever endorse me!

Cruz will say anything that is contrary to what you have to say. If you're for Motherhood he'll be against it!

Just released that international gangs are all over our cities. This will end when I am President!

Ted Cruz is incensed that I want to refocus NATO on terrorism as well as current mission but also want others to PAY FAIR SHARE a must!

A detainee released from Gitmo has killed an American. When will our so-called "leaders" ever learn!

The United States cannot continue to make such bad one-sided trade deals. There are only so many jobs we can give up. No more!

See Lyin' Ted even the DailyBeast says this story came from Rubio not Trump! 

Just to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than Cruz-Lawsuit coming

Why can't the pundits be honest? Hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again. I will make it strong and great!  JOBS!

Another radical Islamic attack this time in Pakistan targeting Christian women & children. At least 67 dead400 injured. I alone can solve

Happy Easter to all have a great day!

My statement on NATO being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive (and unfair) for the U.S. are now finally receiving plaudits!

Wow sleepy eyes Chuck Todd is at it again. He is do totally biased. The things I am saying are correct. - far better vision than the others

Remember I am the only candidate who is self-funding. While I am given little credit for this by the voters I am not bought like others!

Don't believe the Fox News Polls they are just another phony hit job on me. I will beat Hillary Clinton easily in the General Election.

Wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in U.S. jobs are leaving. I will make our economy strong again - bring in jobs

Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J. Trump. Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong. Illegals out!

Lyin' Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enq.were caused by me. I had NOTHING to do with story!

The press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women when they know that it is just the opposite!

The media is so after me on women  Wow this is a tough business. Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump!

Your instincts on foreign policy & terrorism have been better than all of these so called experienced politicians combined.

Top suspect in Paris massacre Salah Abdeslam who also knew of the Brussels attack is no longer talking. Weak leaders ridiculous laws!

Lyin Ted blames me for so many things I am starting to think he is having a mental health crisis.

Wow just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me. How am I still number one - by a lot?

I didn't start the fight with Lyin'Ted Cruz over the GQ cover pic of Melania he did. He knew the PAC was putting it out - hence Lyin' Ted!

Just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the Trump U case but the press refuses to write about it. If I lost-monster story! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Europe and the U.S. must immediately stop taking in people from Syria. This will be the destruction of civilization as we know it! So sad!

Just announced that as many as 5000 ISIS fighters have infiltrated Europe. Also many in U.S.  I TOLD YOU SO! I alone can fix this problem!

They're all brain-dead puppets with skeletons in their closet. I say you go on and destroy them all" A dead show

Explain how the women on The View which is a total disaster since the great Barbara Walters left ever got their jobs. @abc is wasting time

The View which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air is constantly asking me to go on.

Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years. TIME FOR A CHANGE I WILL SOLVE AND FAST! Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years. TIME FOR A CHANGE I WILL SOLVE AND FAST!

It is amazing how often I am right only to be criticized by the media. Illegal immigration take the oil build the wall Muslims NATO!

Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a "hell hole" and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article. I was so right!

These politicians like Cruz and Graham who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years do nothing to make things better!

Lindsay Graham and Lyin' Ted Cruz are two politicians who are very much alike - ALL TALK AND NO ACTION! Both talk about ISIS do nothing!

It is amazing how Lindsey Graham gets on so many T.V. shows talking negatively about me when I beat him so badly in his pres run!

Thank God is not a politician but he's one heck of a fighter who will fight for us the people.

We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of N.A.T.O. Why? It is time to renegotiate and the time is now!

N.A.T.O. is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on!

I want to thank Joe for all of his help in our historic Arizona win. Could not have done it without you Joe!

While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race!

I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted. Jeb spent more than $1500000 and got nothing. I spent a fraction of that and am first!

I will be the best by far in fighting terror. Im the only one that was right from the beginning & now Lyin Ted & others are copying me.

Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror. Shes been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are!

Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates Lyin Ted Cruz. Honestly I cant blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion!

Lyin Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me and lines from Michael Douglas just another dishonest politician.

Thank you Arizona! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpTrain 

Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania. That's why we call him Lyin' Ted!

Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices!

Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona. Thank you I will never forget!

Incompetent Hillary despite the horrible attack in Brussels today wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in.  No way!

Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful Lyin' Ted or I will spill the beans on your wife!

Pres. Obama should leave the baseball game in Cuba immediately & get home to Washington- where a #POTUS under a serious emergency belongs!

Obama and all others have been so weak and so politically correct that terror groups are forming and getting stronger! Shame.

My heart & prayers go out to all of the victims of the terrible Brussels tragedy. This madness must be stopped and I will stop it.

Watch this clip from earlier this year. Time & time again I have been right about terrorism. Its time to get tough! 

I have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody- and its not even close. Hopefully AZ and UT will be voting for me today!

President Obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in Cuba especially in the shadows of Brussels. He is being treated badly!

Do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place Brussels was. Not anymore it is from a different world! U.S. must be vigilant and smart! The media is corrupt! We The People are fighting with you.

Wow President Obama just landed in Cuba a big deal and Raul Castro wasn't even there to greet him. He greeted Pope and others. No respect

So the highly overrated anchor Megan Kelly is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show but I can't fight back? Wrong!

The protesters blocked a major highway yesterday delaying entry to my RALLY in Arizona by hours and the media blames my supporters!

Why is it that the horrendous protesters who scream curse punch shut down roads/doors during my RALLIES  are never blamed by media? SAD!

The rallies in Utah and Arizona were great! Tremendous crowds and spirit. Just returned but will be going back soon.

You are a true journalistic professional. I so agree with what you say. Keep up the great work! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Watching your show from Arizona where we just had a big rally. It is fantastic- everybody loves it!

Wow @CNN ratings are up 75% because it's "all Trump all the time." The networks are making a fortune off of me! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

If crazy Megan Kelly didn't cover me so much on her terrible show her ratings would totally tank. She is so average in so many ways!

Crazy Megan Kelly says I don't (won't) go on her show and she still gets good ratings. But almost all of her shows are negative hits on me! LYIN' TED 

Honored to be in Utah with retired General Robert C. Oaks. We are so thankful for his support and endorsement here.

Reading New York times is a total waste of time he is a clown with no awareness of the world around him- dummy!

While I have never met New York Times of the NY Times I consider him one of the dumbest of all pundits- he has no sense of the real world!

Just leaving Salt Lake City Utah- fantastic crowd with no interruptions.  Love Utah. I will be back! Utah Speaker of the House announces endorses me! 

Why haven't they released the final Missouri victory for us yet? Could it be because Cruz's guy runs Missouri?

I guess I have reached yet another "ceiling"  - 49.7% with four people. My highest Reuters poll yet! Thank you! 

Do you believe that Hillary Clinton now wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants? She should spend more time taking care of our great Vets! LYIN' TED 

Everybody should boycott the Megan Kelly show. Never worth watching. Always a hit on Trump! She is sick & the most overrated person on tv.

Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost! Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary

Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney was campaigning with John Kasich & Marco Rubio and now he is endorsing Ted Cruz. 1/2

Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney the man who "choked" and let us all down is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz. This is good for me!

Going to Salt Lake City Utah for a big rally. Lyin' Ted Cruz should not be allowed to win there.  Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary. Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary

Club for Growth letter- trying to extort $10000.00 from me. Remember I said- NO! 

Club For Growth tried to extort $10000 from me. When I said NO they went hostile with negative ads. Disgraceful!

With millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment my numbers continue to go up. Can anyone explain this?

Eric Erickson got fired like a dog from RedState and now he is the one leading opposition against me.

Senator Lindsey Graham made horrible statements about Senator Ted Cruz  and then he endorsed him. No wonder nobody trusts politicians!

Lyin' Ted Cruz lost all five races on Tuesday-and he was just given the jinx - a Lindsey Graham endorsement. Also backed Jeb. Lindsey got 0!

Hillary Clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life!

Who should star in a reboot of Liar Liar- Hillary Clinton or Ted Cruz? Let me know. 

Highly overrated & crazy Megan Kelly is always complaining about Trump and yet she devotes her shows to me. Focus on others Megyn!

Looking like my 5 victories on Tuesday will be just as good as if I won Ohio. Two more days and Ohio was mine!

Please explain to the dummies at the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board that I love to debate and have won according to Drudge etc. all 11 of them!

Wall Street Journal is bad at math. The good news is nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore especially me!

The reason lyin' Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem! Wow just won Missouri!

Crazy Megan Kelly is now complaining that Bill did not defend her against me. Her bad show is a total hit piece on me.Tough!

Great news that FoxNews has cancelled the additional debate. How many times can the same people ask the same question? I beat Cruz debating. Wow just won Missouri!

Crazy Megan Kelly supposedly had lyin' Ted Cruz on her show last night. Ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse. Ted can't win!

Stuart Stevens the failed campaign manager of Mitt Romney's historic loss is now telling the Republican Party what to do with Trump. Sad! Wow just won Missouri!

RT @JohnStossel: I can skate here ONLY b/c @realdonaldtrump fixed this rink after NYC govt spent $13M but FAILED! Good for Trump! 

I am making a big speech the night of the @FoxNews debate but I wish everyone well. Yesterday was a big day for me with 5 wins!

Thank you to the Governor of Florida Rick Scott for your endorsement. I greatly appreciate your support! Thank you Little Marco I agree!

In the last 2 weeks I had $35M of negative ads against me in Florida & I won in a massive landslide. The establishment should save their money! Thank you Little Marco I agree!

Yesterday was five amazing victories. Lyin Ted Cruz had zero. Things are going very well! Is this what we want for a President? Thank you Little Marco I agree! 

I only wish my wonderful daughter Tiffany could have been with us at Mar-a-Lago for our great election victory. She is a winner! Thank you Little Marco I agree!

Can't watch Crazy Megyn anymore. Talks about me at 43% but never mentions that there are four people in race. With two people big & over!

If media wasn't so biased against me I would've won all of the delegates. Megan Kelly is trying so hard to bash me. Don't worry everyone is wise to Crazy Megyn!

Word is that despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads I had a massive victory in Florida. Numbers out soon!

A lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in Florida? Hope this is false.

I will bring our jobs back to the U.S. and keep our companies from leaving. Nobody else can do it. Our economy will "sing" again.

In presidential voting so far John Kasich is ZERO for 22. So why would he be a good candidate? Hillary would beat him I will beat Hillary!

Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico now losing Ford (and many others). Kasich is weak on illegal immigration. We need strong borders now!

Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. Remember him in second debate until I put him down.

Mathematically it is statistically impossible for Kasich to get to 1237. He would need 112% of the remaining delegates to beat me

North Carolina lost 300000 manufacturing jobs and Ohio lost 400000 since 2000. Going to Mexico etc. NO MORE IF I WIN WE WILL BRING BACK! LYIN' TED 

Don't reward Mitt Romney who let us all down in the last presidential race by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA open borders etc.). LYIN' TED 

Please remember I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists! LYIN' TED 

I will bring our jobs back to America fix our military and take care of our vets end Common Core and ObamaCare protect 2nd A build WALL

Rubio is weak on illegal immigration with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in many years. He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! LYIN' TED 

Kasich voted for NAFTA a disaster for Ohio and now wants the even worse TPP approved. Vote Trump and end this madness! Who started this mess the protesters of course . And media made it worse. LYIN' TED 

Sadly this kind of stuff even happened to Ronald Reagan. There is nothing nice about it! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain. Kasich has helped decimate the coal and steel industries in Ohio. I will bring them back! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Gov Kasich voted for NAFTA which devastated Ohio and is now pushing TPP hard- bad for American workers! LYIN' TED 

The failing @nytimes is truly one of the worst newspapers. They knowingly write lies and never even call to fact check. Really bad people!

Because Gov. Kasich cannot run in the state of Pennsylvania-he cannot win the nomination- & should not be allowed to compete in Ohio on Tue.

Carly Fiorina- I agree! Ted Cruz is just another politician. All talk- no action! LYIN' TED 

Thank you Kevin. With unification of the party Republican wins will be massive!  

Gov.Kasich of Ohio just stated on a morning show that he doesn't watch politics or anything on television he only watches the @GolfChannel

Ohio Gov.Kasich voted for NAFTA from which Ohio has never recovered. Now he wants TPP which will be even worse. Ohio steel and coal dying!

Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie or my supporters will go to yours!

Wow Kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of Pennsylvania not enough signatures. Big problem! LYIN' TED 

Chaos in Chicago was a planned attack. But Hillary insists it was a spontaneous reaction to an internet

USSS did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage. He has ties to ISIS. Should be in jail! 

Do the people of Ohio know that John Kasich is STRONGLY in favor of Common Core! In other words education of your children from D.C. No way!


Just finished my second speech. 20K in Dayton & 25K in Cleveland- perfectly behaved crowd. Thanks. I love you Ohio! 

It is Clinton and Sanders people who disrupted my rally in Chicago - and then they say I must talk to my people. Phony politicians!

The last person that Hillary or Bernie want to run against is Donald Trump and that is fact!

We are asking law enforcement to check for dishonest early voting in Florida- on behalf of little Marco Rubio.  No way to run a country!

Word is-early voting in FL is very dishonest. Little Marco his State Chairman & their minions are working overtime-trying to rig the vote. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

On my way to Dayton Ohio. Will be there soon!

The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled. Will be great - love you Ohio!

Ohio had the biggest budget increase in the U.S. If it were not for striking oil they would be bust! Governor Kasich in favor of TPP fraud!

Absentee Governor Kasich voted for NAFTA and NAFTA devastated Ohio - a disaster from which it never recovered. Kasich is good for Mexico!

The organized group of people many of them thugs who shut down our First Amendment rights in Chicago have totally energized America!

I just got off the phone with the great people of Guam! Thank you for your support! #VoteTrump today!

Great news! Thank you Governor Ralph DLG Torres! #Trump2016  

It means so much to me- receiving an endorsement from Phyllis Schlafly. A truly great woman & conservative. 

Thank you St. Louis Missouri!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Rumor has it that Politico is going out of business. Losing too much money. Great news! Likewise dopey Mort Zuckerman's. Dr. Ben Carson. I concur.

Probably with all pundits saying last fall I had no chance is that shows media so out of touch with Americans

Donald Trump is your man America. He is the best!! Vote for him!" Thank you!

Wow you are all correct about FoxNews - totally biased and disgusting reporting.

Keep lightweight Marco and his friends out of the White House.   

Phony Club For Growth tried to shake me down for one million dollars & is now putting out nasty negative ads on me. They are total losers!

Word is I am doing very well in Michigan and Mississippi! Wow and with all that money spent against me! Will be going to Trump Jupiter now!

I hear MSM came out with another one of their phony polls. While I am leading they are totally discredited after last S.C. poll
Aloha Hawaii: We would be honored to have your vote! Find your caucus 

The negative television commercials about me paid for by the politicians bosses are a total #Mediafraud. When you watch remember!

Mitt Romney had his chance and blew it. Lindsey Graham ran for president got ZERO and quit! Why are they now spokesmen against me? Sad!

Remember I am the only one who is self-funding my campaign. All of the other candidates are bought and paid for by special interests!

Sun Sentinel says: Rubio lacks the experience work ethic and gravitas needed to be president. HE HAS NOT EARNED YOUR VOTE!

Michigan Mississippi Idaho & Hawaii: Get out to VOTE and join the movement today! Video: 

The Club for Growth is a very dishonest group. They represent conservative values terribly & are bad for America. 

People forget it was Club for Growth that asked me for $1 million. I said no & they went negative. Extortion! 

Ted Cruz Was For Welcoming Syrian Refugees Before He Was Against It 

I employ many people in Hawaii at my great hotel in Honolulu. Ill be there very soon. Vote for me Hawaii!

Cruz came to Mississippi there was nobody there he left the state. I had a rally in Madison MS with 10000!  Thank you!

New ad concerning lightweight Senator Marco Rubio:  

Thank you Idaho! I love your potatoes-  nobody grows them better. As  President I will protect your market. 

Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio features Trump Univ. students in FL. attack ads- who submitted "excellent" reviews. 

It was great being in Michigan. Remember I am the only presidential candidate who will bring jobs back to the U.S.and protect car industry!

Don't believe the millions of dollars of phony television ads by lightweight Rubio and the R establishment. Dishonest people!

Leaving for North Carolina. Big crowd will be fun!

Congratulation to Adam Scott and all of the folks at Trump National Doral on producing a really great WGC Tournament. Amazing finish!

I will be using Facebook and Twitter to expose dishonest lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. A record no-show in Senate he is scamming Florida

We cannot let the failing REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT who could not stop Obama (twice) ruin the MOVEMENT with millions of  $'s in false ads!

Lindsey Graham is all over T.V. much like failed 47% candidate Mitt Romney. These nasty angry jealous  failures have ZERO credibility!

Failed presidential candidate Lindsey Graham should respect me. I destroyed his run brought him from 7% to 0% when he got out. Now nasty!

How do you fight millions of dollars of fraudulent commercials pushing for crooked politicians? I will be using Facebook & Twitter. Watch!

All of the phony T.V. commercials against me are bought and payed for by SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS the bandits that tell your pols what to do

I am at Trump National Doral-best resort in U.S. Rory and Adam Scott are doing great! Watch on NBC at 3:00 P.M.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Thank you to @jdickerson and @FaceTheNation for a very fair and professional interview this morning. No wonder you are #1 in the ratings!

Fraud lightweight Marco made a TV ad on TrumpU featuring 2 people who signed these letters: 

The primary plaintiff in the phony Trump University suit wants to abandon the case. Disgraceful!

Nancy Reagan the wife of a truly great President was an amazing woman. She will be missed!

David Brooks of the New York Times is closing in on being the dumbest of them all. He doesnt have a clue.

I am watching two clown announcers on Fox News as they try to build up failed presidential candidate Little Marco. Fox News is in the bag!

Romney's failed advisors like campaign mgr Stuart Stevens are all over TV telling people how to win. But they lost- don't know how to win!

Mitt Romney was a disaster candidate who had no guts and choked! Romney is a total joke and everyone knows it!

Thank you Kansas! The line going into the Orlando event is over a mile long. Massive crowd expected. Leaving Kansas now be there soon!

#CaucusForTrump #Trump2016

Thank you Kansas! Thousands of people inside- and thousands outside who couldn't get into the hall. Really amazing! #CaucusForTrump

To the people of Kentucky  Rand Paul didn't want you. Now he runs back due to his presidential failure.  #VoteTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Why would anyone in Kentucky listen to failed presidential candidate Rand Paul re: caucus. Made a fool of himself (1%.) KY his 2nd choice! Wow big lines in Kansas.

For all of today's voters please remember that I am the only candidate that is self funding my campaign I am not bought and paid for!

Great time last night in Louisiana. Big and energetic crowd. Go out and vote now polls open. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I am in Kansas. Will be an exciting day. Big speech this morning in Wichita and then go to caucus. Sorry CPAC (the format was fine!). 

U.S. Senator Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) issued the following statement today regarding the 2016 presidential election: 

Mary Kissel is an SNL character right? She's not a real person right? #MorningJoe"  She is a major loser. No clue!

The Better Business Bureau report with an A rating for Trump University. #GOPDebate 

Rubio puts out ad that my pilot was a drug dealer- not true not my pilot! Guy owned helicopter company- don't think I ever even used.

Senator Sessions will serve as the  Chairman of my National Security  Advisory Committee. 

People are just mad that you're doing so good so they are gonna do they're best to stop you. Not gonna happen #MAGA. Now Romney wants to do it again.

The phony lawsuit against Trump U could have been easily settled by me but I want  to go to court. 98% approval rating by students. Easy win

As predicted Trump reaching out to make peace with Republican "establishment".  If he becomes inevitable party would be

Why did Mitt Romney BEG me for my endorsement four years ago?

I am the only one who can beat Hillary Clinton. I am not a Mitt Romney who doesn't know how to win. Hillary wants no part of "Trump

Why would the great people of Florida vote for a guy who as a Senator never even shows up to vote - worst record. Marco Rubio is a joke!

I have brought millions of people into the Republican Party while the Dems are going down. Establishment wants to kill this movement!

Failed candidate Mitt Romneywho ran one of the worst races in presidential historyis working with the establishment to bury a big "R" win!

Looks like two-time failed candidate Mitt Romney is going to be telling Republicans how to get elected. Not a good messenger!

Millions of dollars being spent on false TV ads by special interest groups who own Rubio & Cruz.When you see them think of your puppet POLS

The establishment doesn't like me because they can't control me and get me to lie to you and keep ripping you off.

Because of me the Republican Party has taken in millions of new voters a record. If they are not careful they will all leave. Sad! I would love to see the Republican party and everyone get together- and unify.

Just another desperate move by the man who should have easily beaten Barrack Obama.

Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney is having a news conference tomorrow to criticize me. 

I am going to repeal and replace ObamaCare! Read more about my positions on healthcare reform here. Fox muppets!

CNN poll just hit 49% for Trump. Interesting how my numbers have gone so far up since lightweight Marco Rubio has turned nasty. Love it!

And you and the rest of you Fox muppets refuse to HEAR HIM.

Why can't the leaders of the Republican Party see that I am bringing in new voters by the millions-we are creating a larger stronger party! My wife MELANIA TRUMP! I took Trump University class and saved my home!

Marco Rubio lost big last night. I even beat him in Virginia where he spent so much time and money. Now his bosses are desperate and angry!

Why would anyone in Florida vote for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. Check out his credit card scam his house sale & his no show voting!

The special interests and people who control our politicians (puppets) are spending $25 million on misleading and fraudulent T.V. ads on me.

Got the endorsement of Brian France and NASCAR yesterday in Georgia. Also many of the sports great drivers. Thank you Nascar and Georgia!

Governor Alejandro Garc\xc3\xada Padilla said presidential hopeful Sen. Marco Rubio is no friend of Puerto Rico."

Thank you. 32000 supporters tonight. Get out & VOTE on Tuesday! WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Our law enforcement officers deserve our appreciation for the incredible job they do. Video: 

I will be making a big surprise announcement to the massive crowd assembled in Huntsville/Madison Alabama! Landing now! #Trump2016

Phylis Schlafly: 'Marco Rubio Betrayed Us All' 

Little Marco Rubio treated America's ICE officers "like absolute trash" in order to pass Obama's amnesty. 

Little Marco Rubio gave amnesty to criminal aliens guilty of "sex offenses." DISGRACE! 

Little Marco Rubio is just another Washington D.C. politician that is all talk and no action. #RobotRubio 

Rubio was kicking back on his $80k boat he bought with lobbyist money and claimed it was from book sale profit lol

Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio is polling very poorly in Florida. The people can't stand him for missing so many votes - poor work ethic!

Little Marco Rubio the lightweight no show Senator from Florida is just another Washington politician. 

Mitt Romney didn't show his tax return until SEPTEMBER 212012 and then only after being humiliated by Harry R! A bad messenger for estab!

As I stated at the press conference on Friday regarding David Duke- I disavow. 

Why would the people of Texas support Ted Cruz when he has accomplished absolutely nothing for them. He is another all talk no action pol!

Little Marco Rubio the lightweight no show Senator from Florida is set to be the "puppet" of the special interest Koch brothers. WATCH!

Making a big speech in Alabama today. So many people we had to move to a football stadium! Come and join us!

I am the only Republican who will get large numbers of Dems and Indies (crossover). I will also get states that no other Republican can get.

While Hillary and I both won South Carolina by big margins Repubs got far more votes with a massive increase from past cycles.GROWING PARTY

The Republican Establishment has been pushing for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio to say anything to "hit" Trump.I signed the pledge-careful

While I hear the Koch brothers are in big financial trouble (oil) word is they have chosen little Marco Rubio the lightweight from Florida. A lot more water after this bombshell Rubio. You are an enemy of America.

It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep. It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.
It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.

It is a sad commentary little boy Marco Rubio can't win in his home state. Floridians despise him as a opportunist phony.

We need to fix our broken education system! #StopCommonCore RogerStone was just banned by CNN - their loss! Tough loyal guy.

I started my business with very little and built it into a great company with some of the best real estate assets in the World. Amazing!

I only wish my wonderful father Fred gave me $200 million to start my business like lightweight Rubio says. He didn't - total fabrication!

Fun to watch the Democrats working so hard to win the great State of South Carolina when I just won the Republican version - amazing people!

I am self-funding my campaign and am therefore not controlled by the lobbyists and special interests like lightweight Rubio or Ted Cruz!

Tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit. After the audit no problem!

I unfairly get audited by the I.R.S. almost every single year. I have rich friends who never get audited. I wonder why?

A majority of evangelicals believe I am best equipped to save the country. #Greta

What I would do on my first day in office. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Never let them see you sweat! 

They don't like Rubio in Florida- he left them high and dry. Doesn't even show up for votes!

Lightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night. The problem is he is a choker and once a choker always a choker! Mr. Meltdown.

Wow every poll said I won the debate last night. Great honor!

Lightweight choker Marco Rubio looks like a little boy on stage. Not presidential material!

Lying Ted Cruz and lightweight choker  Marco Rubio teamed up last night in a last ditch effort to stop our great movement. They failed!

Will be at Fort Worth (Texas) Convention Center at 11:30 A.M. Big crowd - get there early! Big announcement to be made!

Why would the people of Florida vote for Marco Rubio when he defrauded them by agreeing to represent them as their Senator and then quit!

Have a good chance to win Texas on Tuesday. Cruz is a nasty guy not one Senate endorsement and despite talk gets nothing done. Loser!

I will be making a speech at 12:00 in Fort Worth Texas. Really big crowd expected. Will be talking about the debate last night-plus plus!

Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney was made to look like a fool by Senator Harry Reid & didn't release his tax returns.

FMR PRES of Mexico Vicente Fox horribly used the F word when discussing the wall. He must apologize! If I did that there would be a uproar!

Early on Ted Cruz said that if he didn't win South Carolina it's over. He didn't win- and lost to me in a landslide! Signing a recent tax return- isn't this ridiculous? 

Just for your info tax returns have 0 to do w/ someones net worth. I have already filed my financial statements w/ FEC. They are great!

Why doesnt Mitt Romney just endorse Marco Rubio already. Should have done it before NH or Nevada where he had a little sway. Too late now!

Mitt Romney who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics is now pushing me on tax returns. Dope!

Great new poll. Thank you Texas! #VoteTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

Ted Cruz is lying again. Polls are showing that I do beat Hillary Clinton head to head.

That's why we are angry. The Republican Establishment will not support you. You are who the American people want!

This Texan will be voting Trump March 1st. Cruz is a fake Texan!

Chris thank you so much for your wonderful endorsement. I will not let you down! 

When Ted Cruz quits the race and the field begins to clear I will get most of his votes - no problem!

Why would Texans vote for "liar" Ted Cruz when he was born in Canada lived there for 4 years-and remained a Canadian citizen until recently

When Mitt Romney asked me for my endorsement last time around he was so awkward and goofy that we all should have known he could not win! He's a fool!

Mitt Romney who totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool is now playing tough guy. He's a fool!

The polls show that I picked up many Jeb Bush supporters. That is how I got to 46%. When others drop out I will pick up more.  Sad but true. He's a fool! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

In all of television- the only one who said anything bad about last nights landslide victory-- was dopey @KarlRove. He should be fired!

I am self funding my campaign & don't owe anybody anything! I only owe it to the American people! 

I beat both Hillary and Bernie and I haven't even started on them yet!

MELANIA TRUMP did great on television this morning. Poised smart and strong with a big heart - so much to offer. We are all proud of you! 

Make sure you get on the Trump line and are not mislead by the Cruz people. They are bad! BE CAREFUL.

Very proud of what my father has accomplished in the past 7 months -Wishing him amazing luck and success tonight! #NVcaucus 

My wife Melania will be on Morning Joe tomorrow morning at 8:00.  

Club for Growth is the group that came to my office seeking $1 million dollars. I told them no and now they are doing negative ads.

Great. Just reported on Fox News that many people who supported JebBush are now supporting me. I knew that would happen pundits didn't!

Wow great Ohio poll. Shows me leading by 5 points beating K!

Unlike the other Republican candidates I will be in Nevada all day and night - I won't be fleeing in and out. I love & invest in Nevada!

I am growing the Republican Party tremendously - just look at the numbers way up! Democrats numbers are significantly down from years past.

TRUMP IS UNSTOPPABLE....HE IS WHAT COMMON SENSE AMERICANS WANT WHETHER REPUBLICAN INDEPENDENT OR A REAGAN DEMOCRAT.

Ed Rollins gets it. Was just on Fox News explaining how Trump wins the general election. Thank you Ed!

Ted Cruz lifts the Bible high into the air and then lies like a dog-over and over again! The Evangelicals in S.C. figured him out & said no!

Ted Cruz does not have the right "temperment" to be President. Look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm. BAD!

Wow was Ted Cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication. He used him as a scape goat-fired like a dog! Ted panicked.

Ted Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in S.C. He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration.

A big fat hit job on CNN tonight. A total waste of time to watch boring and biased. Said I would never run a dope!

Just watched the very incompetent Mitt Romney Campaign Strategist Stuart Stevens. Now I know why Mitt lost so badly. Stevens is a clown!

Ted Cruz should be disqualified from his fraudulent win in Iowa. Weak RNC and Republican leadership probably won't let this happen! Sad.

Just saw the phony ad by Cruz - totally false more dirty tricks. He got caught in so many lies - is this man crazy?

Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks. No wonder he has lost Evangelical support!

Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false - no basis in fact. Take ad down Ted. Biggest liar in politics!

Wow Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director. More dirty tricks!

It is so important to audit The Federal Reserve and yet Ted Cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done.

Thank you for your endorsement @paulteutulsr! #BikersForTrump #VoteTrumpNV Video: 

Many people are now saying I won South Carolina because of the last debate. I showed anger and the people of our country are very angry!

Florida starts early voting on March 5 extending to March 15. Absentee ballots have been sent out!

No matter what liar sleazeball says about Lyin Cruz in Tennessee. We have early voting.

I hear the Rickets family who own the Chicago Cubs are secretly spending $'s against me. They better be careful they have a lot to hide!

The reason that Ted Cruz lost the Evangelicals in S.C. is because he is a world class LIAR and Evangelicals do not like liars!

I am in Las Vegas at the best hotel (by far) Trump International. I will be working with my wonderful teams and volunteers to WIN Nevada!

A number of months ago I was not expected to win South CarolinaTed Cruz was and yet I won in a landslide - every group and category. WIN!

Just back from a dinner in West Hollywood: shocked the majority of the table was voting for Trump.

What a great night. Thank you South Carolina a special place with truly amazing people! LOVE

People gave me no chance in South Carolina. Now it looks like a possible win. I would be happy with a one vote victory! (HOPE)

South Carolina voters have the future of our country in their hands. Vote now (today) and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Remember that Marco Rubio is very weak on illegal immigration. South Carolina needs strength as illegals and Syrians pour in. Don't allow it

I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go!

Trump expressed concerns months after the Iraq War began while 60% of Americans still supported the war. 
TheTrump phenomenon summed up: Leadership Fighter and Winner. Not a Liar 

I am the only candidate (in many years) who is self-funding his campaign. Lobbyists and $ interests totally control all other candidates!

FoxNews is really starting to campaign hard for marcorubio. #fairandbalancedmyass"  He is weak on illegal immigration!

I'm a Regan Dem and believe in your message! God bless you and your campaign!

Just finished two major speeches in South Carolina. Big crowds great people. Going for a third now!

Boycott all Apple products  until such time as Apple gives cellphone info to authorities regarding radical Islamic terrorist couple from Cal

Hopefully others will follow suit. Our country needs & should demand security. It is time to get tough & be smart!

I use both iPhone & Samsung. If Apple doesn't give info to authorities on the terrorists I'll only be using Samsung until they give info.

I have built so many great & complicated projects creating tens of thousands of jobs-video: 

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016  

Remember Cruz and Bush gave us Roberts who upheld #ObamaCare twice! I am the only one who will #MAKEAMERICAGREATAGAIN!

Im self-funding and I am going to take care of the people  not the special interests and insurance companies like the other candidates.

I will replace it with private plans health savings accounts & allow purchasing across state lines. Maximum choice & freedom for consumer.

I was referring to a backstop for pre-existing conditions. I will eliminate the law in its entirety & replace it w/ something much better. I agree with Marco Rubio that Ted Cruz is a liar!

I was asked about healthcare by Anderson Cooper & have been consistent- I will repeal all of #ObamaCare including the mandate period.

I agree with Marco Rubio that Ted Cruz is a liar!

.@FoxNews is changing their  theme from "fair and balanced" to "unfair and unbalanced." But dying @WSJ is worse.Their phony poll is a  joke!

New CBS National Poll just out - massive lead for Trump. The Wall Street Journal/NBC Poll is a total joke. No wonder WSJ is doing so badly!

I love being in South Carolina. We are leading big in all of the State polls - Saturday is a BIG day. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

The just out USA Today National Poll where I lead by big numbers shows that in a head to head matchup I beat both Hillary and Bernie.

Amazing that while I lead by big numbers in the new Q and and USA Today polls the the press only wants to report on the phony WSJ/NBC poll.

Jeb Bush just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses. He wants to look cool but it's far too late. 1% in Nevada!

Just out Nevada poll shows Jeb Bush at 1% he should take his dumb mouthpiece @LindseyGrahamSC and just go home.

FoxNews is so biased it is disgusting. They do not want Trump to win. All negative!

I will beat Hillary easily but Lindsey Graham says I won't and yet he got zero against me- no cred! Why does FOX put him on?

He had zero in his presidential run before dropping out in disgrace- saying the most horrible things about me on FoxNews.

Interesting how President Obama so haltingly said I "would never be president" - This from perhaps the worst president in U.S. history!

Why does Megan Kelly devote so much time on her shows to me almost always negative?  Without me her ratings would tank. Get a life Megyn!

Explain to Megan Kelly who know nothing that I will beat Hillary and win states (and dem-indie votes) that no other can!

Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

New PPP Poll just out - Trump up big Cruz Rubio and Bush down. The debate results even with a stacked RNC audience were wonderful!

Spent the full day at meetings and a major rally yesterday in South Carolina. Great people and spirit. Today will be more of the same.

New South Carolina poll from PPP. Thank you! #VoteTrumpSC 

What a night! 10000 amazing supporters in Greenville South Carolina! THANK YOU! VOTE on Saturday! #VoteTrumpSC 

Thank you for your continued support! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

RESPONSE TO THE LIES OF SENATOR CRUZ: 

JEB is a hypocrite! Used massive private "Eminent Domain" --- Just another clueless politician!  

Jeb used Eminent Domain & took advantage of a disabled vet in the process. (2/2) 

I'd like to call JEB a liar but the truth is he has no clue & never revealed that he used Eminent Domain- when criticizing me! 

Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb(!) is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center Iraq War and eco collapse? Careful!

I will be in South Carolina all week. Saturday is BIG BIG BIG! Get out and vote - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates Hillary would destroy them. Ted may not be eligible to run - born in Canada

Funny that Jeb(!) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.Then mommy now brother! Thank you! I miss my father. 

Ted Cruz along with Jeb Bush pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court. Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice but didn't!

Wow in the new CBS Poll I went way up into the forties! Thank you!

Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists & special interests - the bosses!

Loved the debate last night and almost everyone said I won but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution. All donors & special ints

Thank you for your support! TOGETHER we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Thank you! I miss my father. 

I will be on Face the Nation with John Dickerson on CBS this morning. Enjoy! Thank you! I miss my father. 

This shows what a complete & total liar Ted Cruz is- he said he wouldn't have nominated John Roberts. Really? 

Jeb is incompetent and will lose don't waste your energy on that cry baby!

Jeb is incompetent and will lose don't waste your energy on that cry baby!

Jeb is incompetent and will lose don't waste your energy on that cry baby!

Jeb is incompetent and will lose don't waste your energy on that cry baby! Thank you! I miss my father. 

Even though every poll Time Drudge etc. has me winning the debate by a lot FoxNews only puts negative people on. Biased - a total joke! Thank you! I miss my father. 

Crushed the debate! Thank you! Thank you! I miss my father. 

Hey Glenn Beck. See how I beat your boy Ted- in your own Blaze poll? Your endorsement means nothing! 

All polls have me winning debate big- Drudge TIME etc. Dopey Charles Krauthammer still nasty. He has zero cred- totally dishonest!

How can Jeb Bush beat Hillary Clinton- if he can't beat anyone else on the GOPDebate stage with $150M? I am the only one who can! Thank you! I miss my father.  

Lightweight @JebBush said tonight he didn't know his family used private eminent domain in Texas- Lie!  #GOPDebate

On the way to the #GOPDebate with my wonderful wife @MelaniaTrump. 

Ted Cruz is a cheater! He holds the Bible high and then lies and misrepresents the facts!

Nasty Ted Cruz is at it again- same dirty tricks he used w/ @RealBenCarson- saying I may not be on ballot & I hold liberal positions. LIES!

Wow! Honored to be chosen by the highly respected + accurate Washington & Lee Mock Convention. I hope you are right - I will make you proud!

The totally unexpected loss of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is a massive setback for the Conservative movement and our COUNTRY!

Love the people of South Carolina - look very much forward to the debate tonight.

@AmFree: #Trump On #Ford #Carrier Shipping #Jobs To #Mexico: Im The Only One Who Understands Whats Going On 

@ThtsWhtKelSaid: I'm fed up w/ DC playing 3 card Monty w/ our tax $'s. It's time we the people play the Trump card & take back our country

@BrandonSawyer84: @realDonaldTrump will rule #SouthCarolinaPrimary! 

@wino911:  #Trump2016 We know better than to trust the RNC 

RT @EricTrump: Nevada: Reminder that today is the LAST day to register to vote in the February 23rd caucus!

Thank you South Carolina! We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN! 

Get on Trump's List" email from the RNC was not authorized. I am self funding my campaign! Do not pay.  Email: 

A very big thank you to Bill Donohue head of The Catholic League for the wonderful interview on @CNN and article in Newsmax! Great insight

Totally unauthorized do not pay. I am self funding my campaign! Notice has just been withdrawn. #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

The RNC which is probably not on my side just illegally put out a fundraising notice saying Trump wants you to contribute to the RNC.

Now an additional 600-700 jobs in America (2000) being eliminated for move to Mexico- via Hartford Courant. 

Nice column by Bill Donahue head of Catholic League. He's a blue collar New Yorker and gets it 

I am the only one who can fix this. Very sad. Will not happen under my watch! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  

Just got back from Tampa. It was an amazing evening with an even more amazing crowd - fantastic people! Will be in South Carolina tomorrow.

Word is that little Morty Zuckermans @NYDailyNews loses more than $50 million per year---can that be possible?

When little Morty Zuckerman closes his failing @NYDailyNews will I at least be given some credit? Will happen soon.

11000 inside venue tonight in Tampa! Broke record set by Elton John in 1988 w/out musical instruments! Another 5000 outside. Will be back!

I will end illegal immigration and protect our borders! We need to MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN! #Trump2016 

Millions of $'s of false ads  paid for by lobbyists-special interests of cheater @SenTedCruz  and sleepy @JebBush are now running in S.C.


Last time lightweight @JebBush tried to knock off @marcorubio he made a total fool of himself. If he doesn't do better this time he is out!

If TedCruz doesnt clean up his act stop cheating & doing negative ads I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen.

Lightweight JebBush is spending a fortune of special interest against me in SC. False advertising- desperate and sad!

After hearing the news that they would not be able to extort $1M from me they went hostile w/ a series of incorrect & ill-informed ads.

Nothing conservative about the Club for Growth coming into my office and demanding a $1M contribution which naturally they did not get.

You must be registered Republican by February 16th to vote TRUMP in the Florida primary. 

The failing NYDailyNews destroyed by little Morty Zuckerman is preparing to close and save face by going online. It's dead!

NEVADA! Tomorrow is the deadline to register Republican.  Visit: 

How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?

Lying Cruz put out a statement Trump & Rubio are w/Obama on gay marriage." Cruz is the worst liar crazy or very dishonest. Perhaps all 3?

Weak JEB getting thrown out by management during speech. Do you think he will be this tough on Putin & others?  

THANK YOU- Baton Rouge Louisiana! WE will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! #Trump2016 

Just landed in Baton Rouge Louisiana. Reports are out that lines are three quarters of a mile to get in. Wow! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Cruz caught cold in lie after denial of push polls like lies w/ RealBenCarson. How can he preach Christian values? 

Heading to Baton Rouge Louisiana for a speech. Expecting a very large crowd! See you soon. #Trump2016  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

We are getting reports from many voters that the Cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest "pushpolls" on me. We are watching!

Jeb failed as Jeb! He gave up and enlisted Mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of Iraq). Spent $120 million.Weak-no chance!

He (or she) who hesitates is lost: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Remember it was the Republican Party with the help of Conservatives that made so many promises to their base BUT DIDN'T KEEP THEM! Hi DT

Mark Halperin showed a focus group on Morning Joe me using a very bad word. I never said the word left an open blank. Please apologize!

Jeb Bush spent more than $400000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5 I spent $30000 to come in 1st. Big difference in capability!

There are no buyers for the worthless @NYDailyNews but little Mort Zuckerman is frantically looking. It is bleeding red ink - a total loser!

I have been consistent in my opposition to Common Core. Get rid of Common Core--- keep education local! I was referring to the fact that Jeb Bush wants to keep common core.

So funny Jeb Bush called me a "highly gifted politician and a great entertainer" - I assume that is a compliment!

Such a great experience in New Hampshire - amazing people! Will be leaving for a big event in South Carolina today.

Like the worthless NYDailyNews looks like Politico will be going out of business. Bad reporting- no money no cred!

Worthless NYDailyNews which dopey Mort Zuckerman is desperately trying to sell has no buyer! Liabilities are massive!

Dopey Mort Zuckerman owner of the worthless @NYDailyNews has a major inferiority complex. Paper will close soon!

My report card grades for the 2 New Hampshire winners: DonaldTrump A: v strong energy/close. BernieSanders B+: went too long

Thank you to the people of  New Hampshire I love you! Now off to South Carolina.

We will stop heroin and other drugs from coming into New Hampshire from our open southern border. We will build a WALL and have security.

We will immediately repeal and replace ObamaCare - and nobody can do that like me. We will save $'s and have much better healthcare!

ISIS is making big threats today - no respect for U.S.A. or our "leader" - If I win it will be a very different storywith very fast results

The polls are now showing that I am the best to win the GENERAL ELECTION. States that are never in play for Repubs will be won by me. Great!

No-one has done more for people with disabilities than me. I have spent many millions of dollars to help out-and am happy to have done so!

I know the "Governors" and Jeb Bush who has gone nasty with lies is by far the weakest of the lot. His family used private eminent domain!

Remember @JebBush wants COMMON CORE (education from D.C.) and is very weak on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ("come as act of love"). Not a leader!

Now that Bush has wasted $120 million of special interest money on his failed campaign he says he would end super PACs. Sad!

Today's third stop- Londonderry New Hampshire! Thank you! #FITN #VoteTrumpNH 

America needs strong leadership. Politicians can talk but they dont get things done. Video: 

Everybody is laughing at Jeb Bush-spent $100 million and is at bottom of pack. A pathetic figure!

Jeb Bush is desperate - strongly in favor of #CommonCore and very weak on illegal immigration.

Thank you for your support at this mornings Town Hall- in Salem New Hampshire. #FITN #NHPrimary 

Jeb Bush has zero communication skills so he spent a fortune of special interest money on a Super Bowl ad. He is a weak candidate!

My two wonderful sons Don and Eric will be on @foxandfriends at 7:02 - now! Enjoy.

So far the Super Bowl is very boring - not nearly as exciting as politics - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I am in New Hampshire having a great time! Loved the #GOPDebate last night! Everybody enjoy the Super Bowl. #SuperBowlSunday #SB50

Thank you- Plymouth New Hampshire! #FITN #NHPrimary 

Thank you Newt!  

We are going to have a big event at the Verizon Wireless Arena in Manchester New Hampshire! 5K+! Join us tomorrow: 

Great to meet everyone while having breakfast @ChezVachon this morning! 

Trump Kasich Jeb and Christie all had good nights. 

The New Hampshire drug epidemic must stop. If elected POTUS- I will create borders & the drugs will stop pouring in. 

Border agent: "We might as well abolish our immigration laws altogether" 

I said this was happening long ago- I will stop this immediately!  

It never ends!  

I told you so. Our country totally lost control of illegal immigration even with criminals.  

10000 people in South Carolina unbelievable evening! Will be in New Hampshire tomorrow- love it. 

Really dumb Cheri Jacobus. Begged my people for a job. Turned her down twice and she went hostile. Major loser zero credibility!

Donald Trump loves America! He loves Americans! He loves our Vets! #TrumpSupporters 

Watch: Donald Trump OWNS A Heckler Who Said Illegal Immigrants Are The Backbone Of America 

Why vote for Trump? Unlike politicians all talk Trumps talk materializes! He will make America great again

Join me at Clemson University on Wednesday February 10th! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

Heading to South Carolina really big crowd! Will be back in New Hampshire tomorrow. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Such great support in New Hampshire. So many people are working so hard to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!

I very much look forward to tomorrows debate in New Hampshireso many things to say so much at stake. It will be an incredible evening!

Live Free or Die: A motto for the whole country to follow. #NewHampshire #FITN #VoteTrumpNH  

Big storm in New Hampshire. Moved my event to Monday. Will be there next four days.

Join us Monday February 8th @ the Verizon Wireless Arena in Manchester New Hampshire! #FITN #NHPolitics #Trump2016 

I agree. Great businessman. I like your tone tonight! Keep it up & you'll have this Democrats vote.

I will be interviewed by Anderson Cooper at 8pm on @CNN from New Hampshire. Should be very interesting!

Taking a helicopter to New Hampshire boarding now. Amazing activity planned. New UMASS poll very nice! 

Politicians are trying to chip away at the 2nd Amendment. I wont let them take away our guns! #Trump2016 Watch: 

This is the Cruz voter violation certificate sent to everyone a misdemeanor at minimum. 

As per the show an even more serious Cruz charge is the fraudulent voter violation certificate sent to everyone.


Thank you. Ted Cruz should be immediately disqualified in Iowa with each candidate moving up one notch.

Sanders says he wants to run against me because he doesn't want to run against me. He would be so easy to beat!

THANK YOU to everyone in Little Rock Arkansas tonight! A record crowd of 12K. #Trump2016 

Stop the assault on American values. Stand w/ Trump to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! #VotersSpeak: 

Thank you New Hampshire! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #FITN 

Dr. Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for "deceit and dirty tricks and lies.

Cruz just lied again- I am and have been totally against #ObamaCare- repeal and replace!

The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!

This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #CruzFraud 

I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! @FoxNews

Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.

And finally Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie!

The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud

Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.

During primetime of the Iowa Caucus Cruz put out a release that RealBenCarson was quitting the race and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.

Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!

Great job on Don Lemon tonight. Begged us for a job. We said no and she went hostile. A real dummy! CNN

On my way to New Hampshire- expecting a big and spirited crowd!  #FITN #Trump2016  

Anybody who watched all of Ted Cruz's far too long rambling overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his Howard Dean moment!

The #CruzCrew prevailed! Smart for @MarcoRubio to keep his speech short & sweet. Ditto for @realDonaldTrump who was brie

I don't believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign the only one. I will keep doing but not worth it!

I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in New Hampshire. Big crowd

The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history!

Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz & Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honor

My experience in Iowa was a great one. I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place. Nice

So nice to get an endorsement from the founder and owner of Pizza Ranch in Iowa! A great guy and great places! #CaucusForTrump

It is time to take back our country- and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! #CaucusForTrump Video: 

I will be interviewed on Face The Nation with @jdickerson this morning. Enjoy!

I am in Iowa. Will be interviewed on This Week With G Stephanopoulos this morning. ENJOY!

If I would have done the last debate a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). Also VETS got $600

By not doing the failed poorly rated debate I was able to make the point of not allowing "unfairness" - while raising $60000 for VETS.

Wow just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me will repeal & replace. He lies!

Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans scam!

Ted Cruz is totally unelectable if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN!

I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife Melania. After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State!

The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters "in violation." They are now under investigation. Bad!

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  #IACaucus #CaucusForTrump 

#IACaucus #CaucusForTrump #iCaucused #iVoted 

I want to thank evangelical Christians for the warm embrace I've received on the campaign trail. Video: 

I will be in Iowa all day and until Tuesday morning. Finally after all these years of watching stupidity we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Hillary Clinton is a major national security risk. Not presidential material! 

Amazing that Ted Cruz can't even get a Senator like @BenSasse who is easy to endorse him. Not one Senator  is endorsing Canada Ted!

The great State of Nebraska can do much better than @BenSasse as your Senator. Saw him on @greta - totally ineffective. Wants paid for pols.

The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton. At a minimum how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president?

They say that if I participated in last nights Fox debate they would have had 12 million more & would have broken the all time record.

Getting ready to take off for Nashua New Hampshire. Big crowd will be there soon. Fun!

Iowa was amazing last night. The event could not have worked out better. We raised $60000 for our great vets. They were so happy & proud

Thank you for your interest & support during last nights #GOPDebate! #IACaucus finder: 

Good morning America! Thank you for all of your support in the latest Drudge poll! 

Thank you for the kind words tonight @OMAROSA. You were great! See you soon!

I will take care of the Veterans who have served this country so bravely. #ThankAVet Video: 

An unbelievable night in Iowa with our great Veterans! We raised $60000.00 while the politicians talked! #GOPDebate

Watching biased Charles @krauthammer a @FoxNews flunky who didn't know that I won every debate in particular- the last one. Check polls!

I hear that Lyin' Cruz's man Robert Mercer a good man is very angry because Cruz lied to him about liquidating his (Teds) holdings?

I just can't be bought!

The "debate" tonight will be a total disaster - low ratings with advertisers and advertising rates dropping like a rock. I hate to see this.

On Greta 87% of the people said they would not watch the debate if I'm not in it. Wow- what an honor!

FOX debate advertising rates falling like a rock! Tune into my special event for the Veterans at 9pm EST!

Thank you- Lexington South Carolina! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

It was the childishly written & taunting PR statement by Fox that made me not do the debate more so than lightweight reporter Megan Kelly.

I am self funding my campaign so I do not owe anything to lobbyists & special interests. Should I do the GOP debate? 

By not showing I'm owning entire event. 

Even though I beat him in the first six debates especially the last one Ted Cruz wants to debate me again. Can we do it in Canada?

Just got to listen to Rush Limbaugh - the guy is fantastic! Should I do the GOP debate? 

The statement put out yesterday by @FoxNews was a disgrace to good broadcasting and journalism. Who would ever say something so nasty & dumb. Should I do the GOP debate? 

I refuse to call Megyn Kelly a bimbo because that would not be politically correct. Instead I will only call her a lightweight reporter.

Pathetic attempt by Fox to try and build up ratings for the #GOPDebate. Without me they'd have no ratings!  

Should I do the GOP debate? 

Begged me to do an event while asking organizers for $100000 for himself a bad guy!

Great honor- Rev. Jerry Falwell Jr. of Liberty University one of the most respected religious leaders in our nation has just endorsed me! 

For the great people of Iowa find your IACaucus location.

Why doesn't phony  @bobvanderplaats tell his followers all the times he asked for him and his family to stay at my hotels-didn't like paying

I will end common core. It's a disaster. 

Donald Trump retains national lead in new ABC News/WaPo poll with 37%: 

Cruz lies are almost as bad as Jeb's. These politicians will do anything to stay at the trough!

Cruz going down fast in recent polls- dropping like a rock. Lies never work!

Ted Cruz is a nervous wreck. He is making reckless charges not caring for the truth! His poll #'s are way down!

I have a touched a nerve in our country in a way that most politicians have not been able to do. 

It's time for Ted Cruz to either settle his problem with the FACT that he was born in Canada and was a citizen of Canada or get out of race

Trump +15 on Cruz in 2 weeks. Cruz may look back and ask why he ever attacked Trump. DT has killed him ever since. Love making correct predictions. National Review is over.

Fox News Poll Thank you New Hampshire! #FITN #Trump2016 

Love making correct predictions. National Review is over. 

I will make our Military so big powerful & strong that no one will mess with us. #Trump2016 

I will be on Face The Nation this morning at various times across the U.S. CBSNews  Enjoy! Love making correct predictions. National Review is over.

I will be on ABC this morning at various times across the U.S. NBCNews  Enjoy!

Love making correct predictions. National Review is over.  

Word is that crying Glenn Beck left the GOP and doesn't have the right to vote in the Republican primary. Dumb as a rock.

Serious doubt in Illinois as to whether or not Cruz can run for President. First of many challenges. 

Just left a great event in Pella. Going to church tomorrow in Muscatine Iowa.

I will be on FOX with the great Judge Jeanine tonight at 9pm EST! Enjoy! #Trump2016

.@williebosshog such an honor to get your endorsement. You are a fantastic guy! It will not be forgotten. Don and Eric say hello!

Heading now to Pella Iowa. Big crowd! Remember Trump is a big buyer of Pella windows. See you soon!

For the great people of Iowa find your #IACaucus location at 

Just left Sioux Center Iowa. My speech was very well received. Truly great people! Packed house- overflow!

A wonderful story on Iowa voters by @arappeport of the @NYTimes.  

Failing Glenn Beck lost all credibility. Not only was he fired @ FOX he would have voted for Clinton over McCain. 

Based on Megyn Kelly's conflict of interest and bias she should not be allowed to be a moderator of the next debate.

Heading to Sioux County Iowa where the crowd is amazing. Dr. Robert Jeffress will make the introduction. Make America Great Again!

Ted Cruz poll numbers are down big. Because he was born in Canada and was until recently a Canadian citizen many believe he cannot run!

I am in Iowa watching all of these phony T.V. ads by the other candidates. All bull politicians are all talk and no action-it won't happen!

.@AnnCoulter has been amazing. We will win and establish strong borders we will build a WALL and Mexico will pay. We will be great again!

I will be the greatest job-producing president in American history. #Trump2016 #VoteTrump  

Dow down almost 2000 pts since start of year but still outperforming Wall Street's investment in Jeb. JEB wants Common Core

I am in Iowa. Will be making two speeches today. Good luck to all of the great folks on the East coast. Enjoy the beauty of the storm!

A wonderful article by a writer who truly gets it. I am for the people and the people are for me. #Trump2016  

Is Cruz honest? He is in bed w/ Wall St. & is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi low interest loans. No legal disclosure & never sold off assets.

Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for #POTUS. He could be Canadian Prime Minister.

Cruz says I supported TARP which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose. Puppet!

The only reason irrelevant @GlennBeck doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times. Very few listeners - sad!

One of the National Review lightweights came to my office begging for money like a dog. Why doesn't he say that?

Just watched Jeb's ad where he desperately needed mommy to help him. Jeb, Mom can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Jeb, your mommy can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

Ted Cruz went down big in just released Reuters poll - what's going on? Is it Goldman Sachs/Citi loans or Canada?

Rush Limbaugh is great tells it as he sees it---really honorable guy! Thanks Rush! #Trump2016

The tax scam Washington Post does among the most inaccurate stories of all. Really dishonest reporting.

Just received the new Fox poll. Thank you America! #Trump2016 

Wow! New National Zogby Poll just out:.TRUMP 45. CRUZ 13. RUBIO 8. Big numbers.

Leaving Nevada now for Iowa. Things are looking good - great new polls!

New Reuters poll! Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

The dying NRO National Review has totally given up the fight against Barrack Obama. They have been losing for years. I will beat Hillary!

Wow! This might be my highest numbers yet! Thank you to my opposition- you are totally ineffective & have been for years! 

I could've sworn I saw him outside Trump Tower the other day! 

@Lisa_Milicaj: Truth be told I  never heard of The National Review until they "tried" to declare war on you. No worries you got my vote!

After spending $89 million @JebBush is at the bottom of the barrel in polls. He is ashamed to use the name "Bush" in ads. Low energy guy!

The failing National Review Magazine has just been informed by the Republican National Committee that they cannot participate in debate

Ted Cruz complains about my views on eminent domain but without it we wouldn't have roads highways airports schools or even pipelines.

Make America Great Again! #Trump2016 

The late great William F. Buckley would be ashamed of what had happened to his prize the dying National Review!

Very few people read the National Review because it only knows how to criticize but not how to lead.

National Review is a failing publication that has lost it's way. It's circulation is way down w its influence being at an all time low. Sad!

Thank you Iowa! #FITN #IACaucus #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Why does Greta have a fired Bushy like dummy John Sununu on- spewing false info? I will beat Hillary by a lot she wants no part of Trump.

Happy birthday to my friend the great @jacknicklaus - a totally special guy!

New Day on CNN treats me very badly. @AlisynCamerota is a disaster. Not going to watch anymore.

Low energy candidate JebBush has wasted $80 million on his failed presidential campaign. Millions spent on me. He should go home and relax!

Sad sack JebBush has just done another ad on me with special interest money saying I won't beat Hillary - I WILL. But he can't beat me.

So sad that CNN and many others refused to show the massive crowd at the arena yesterday in Oklahoma. Dishonest reporting!

Wacko @glennbeck is a sad answer to the @SarahPalinUSA endorsement that Cruz so desperately wanted. Glenn is a failing crying lost soul!

Trump destroyed Hillary & Sanders moved in. But he didn't destroy her. Trump did. 

Palins brand among evangelicals is as gold as the faucets in Trump tower said Ralph Reed the chairman of the Faith & Freedom Coalition.

Wow the highly respected Governor of Iowa just stated that "Ted Cruz must be defeated." Big shoker! People do not like Ted.

A true honor to receive the endorsement of John Wayne's daughter....read: 

In the just released SC poll I increased my lead by 4 points since last poll by same firm. Up by 14! Cruz dropped 3. 

Thank you for your strong testimony when welcoming me to Liberty University yesterday- @JerryJrFalwell. 

Thank you Georgia! I appreciate all of your support. #Trump2016 

Just read your complete statement. You are an amazing guy & I really appreciate your words & support. I will see you soon!

On my way to Iowa- just received new national poll numbers. Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Really disgusting that the failing New York Times allows dishonest writers to totally fabricate stories.

Dope Frank Bruni said I called many people including Karl Rove losers-true! I never called my friend @HowardStern a loser- hes a winner!

Wow new polls just out have Trump up and Cruz down - he is a nervous wreck!

I don't think Ted Cruz can even run for President until he can assure Republican voters that being born in Canada is not a problem. Doubt!

Ted Cruz is falling in the polls. He is nervous. People are worried about his place of birth and his failure to report his loans from banks!

I loved being at Liberty University today! Record setting crowd unbelievable people! Thank you Jerry and Becki! 

We launched a new series of #Trump2016 videos via Facebook. A new topic everyday! Watch: 

A great morning with everyone @LibertyU! Thank you! Off to New Hampshire now. #Trump2016  

Leaving for Liberty University. I'll be speaking today in front of a record crowd. #Trump2016

Just a reminder that Ted Cruz supported liberal Justice John Roberts who gave us #Obamacare. 

Thank you @IvankaTrump for the kind words. I am very proud of the role model you are for so many. NH & IA radio ad: 

I am self-funding my campaign - putting up my own money not controlled.  Cruz is spending $millions on ads paid for by his N.Y. bosses.

Far more killed than anticipated in radical Islamic terror attack yesterday. Get tough and smart U.S. or we won't have a country anymore!

Big announcement in Ames Iowa on Tuesday! You will not want to miss this rally! #Trump2016 

Iran is going to buy 114 jetliners with a small part of the $150 billion we are giving them...but they won't buy from U.S. rather Airbus!

In Iran deal we get 4 prisoners. They get $150 billion 7 most wanted and many off watch list. This will create great incentive for others!

Interesting read from Peggy Noonan. 

Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about & demeaning? 

Wow! Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul & $1M low int. loan from Goldman Sachs. Hypocrite

Departing NH now- great morning with record crowd in Portsmouth- in a snow storm! Thank you! 

Greatly dishonest of Ted Cruz to file a financial disclosure form & not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St

When will Ted Cruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him.

Everybody that loves the people of New York and all they have been thru should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!

If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?

Ted is the ultimate hypocrite. Says one thing for money does another for votes.  

Great new numbers. Thank you!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Ted Cruz purposely and illegally did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!

Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?

Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.

The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there!

Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!

Ted Cruz said he ""didn't know"" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable

Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so

More radical Islam attacks today - it never ends! Strengthen the borders, we must be vigilant and smart. No more being politically correct.

Just got back from Iowa - had a great time with amazing people. Will be back soon!

Top searched candidate by state, as seen in the #GOPDebate media filing center. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Sen. Lindsey Graham embarrassed himself with his failed run for President and now further embarrasses himself with endorsement of Bush.

Jeb Bush, who did poorly last night in the debate and whose chances of winning are zero, just got Graham endorsement. Graham quit at O.

Do you think Iran would have acted so tough if they were Russian sailors? Our country was humiliated.

@Bonfiredesigns: Standing with @realDonaldTrump as he defends our sailors and military and Americans in the USA 

United States looks more and more like a paper tiger. Won't be that way if I win!

Iran humiliated the United States with the capture of our 10 sailors. Horrible pictures & images. We are weak. I will NOT forget!

Stuart Stevens is a dumb guy who fails @ virtually everything he touches. Romney campaign,his book,etc. Why does @andersoncooper put him on?

Why does @CNN & @andersoncooper waste airtime by putting failed campaign strategist, Stuart Stevens - who lost BIG for Romney - on the show?

Sadly, there is no way that Ted Cruz can continue running in the Republican Primary unless he can erase doubt on eligibility. Dems will sue!

Iran toys with U.S. days before we pay them, ridiculously, billions of dollars. Don't release money. We want our hostages back NOW!

Numerous polls have me beating Hillary Clinton. In a race with her, voter turnout will be the highest in U.S. history-I get most new voters!

The State Of The Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time. New leadership fast!

Just found out that @tedcruz is spending a fortune on Iowa push polls negative to me. Not nice, but OK! New polls are great.

The #SOTU speech is really boring, slow, lethargic - very hard to watch!

The Iran deal is terrible. Why didn't we get the uranium stockpile - it was sent to Russia. #SOTU

New CBS poll. #Trump2016 

Another new Iowa poll just released. Thank you! #IACaucus #FITN 

Such a serious problem for Ted & the GOP. Great doubt, Dems will sue! Let's all work together to solve this problem. 

On my way to Cedar Falls, Iowa, now. Will be great--I love the people of Iowa!

Fantastic job on @CNN  tonight. @kayleighmcenany is a winner! @donlemon

Megan Kelly recently said that she cant be wooed by Trump. She is so average in every way, who the hell wants to woo her!

So professional of ABC news to throw out the failing Union Leader newspaper from their debate. Paper won't survive, highly unethical!

Congratulations to my friend Sly Stallone on winning a GoldenG lobe. A wonderful guy- who has created something special, well deserved!

Why does Stephanopoulos allow a hater & racist like @tavissmiley to waste good airtime? ABC can do much better than him!

Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog. For starters, try getting a new publisher!

UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows. They aren't worthy of representing the great people NH.

This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed.

If their highly unethical behavior, including begging me for ads, isnt questionable enough, they have endorsed a candidate who cant win.

I am pleased to announce that I had the Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate. 

Remember, get TIME magazine! I am on the cover. Take it out in 4 years and read it again! Just watch...

Heading now for Reno, Nevada, for a big rally. Good poll numberd all over!

In the just out @FoxNews Poll, I easily beat Hillary Clinton - and I havn't even focused on her yet. On our way: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Yesterday in Iowa was amazing - two speeches in front of two great sold out crowds. They love that I am the only candidate self-funding!

@redletter99: Trump pummels his opponents - and the press | SunHerald @realDonaldTrump "

I want to thank the people of Iowa for an unbelievable day. The crowds were amazing. Will be back Tuesday!

Will be on Meet the Press with @ChuckTodd tomorrow morning. Enjoy!

I will be interviewed by Chris Wallace on Fox tomorrow morning. Tune in!

I'm protesting the @UnionLeader from having anything to do w/ ABC debate. Their unethical record doesn't give them the right to be involved!

David brilliantly tells it like it is -- the real deal! Read it!  

Time Magazine has me on the cover this week. David Von Drehle has written one of the best stories I have ever had.

Thank you so much. Earnest must have been a great person. 

Thank you. It is a true person of character that can change his opinion & do what is right. 

Constitutional law expert  #Laurence Tribe of Harvard says ""wrong to say it (natural born citizen) is a settled matter-it isn't settled).

South Carolina rally last night was so unbelievably exciting (and fun). I am now off to Iowa for two big rallies - packed houses. Love it!

Pat Buchanan gave a fantastic interview this morning on @CNN - way to go Pat, way ahead of your time!

Love seeing union & non-union members alike are defecting to Trump. I will create jobs like no one else. Their #Dem leaders cant compete!

I hope all workers demand that their @Teamsters reps endorse Donald J. Trump. Nobody knows jobs like I do! Dont let them sell you out!

On my way to South Carolina. Big Crowd--- look forward to it!

Not good news for Jeb Bush.

Not good news for Jeb Bush.

Not good news for Jeb Bush.

Not good news for Jeb Bush.

Not good news for Jeb Bush.  

Hank Greenberg, formerly of AIG, gave $10 million to the @JebBush campaign 3 months ago. He is not happy, a total waste of money!

Great time in Burlington, Vermont. Crowd was amazing.

We could only get a small fraction of this 25k crowd in. The movement to Make America Great Again is unbelievable! 

I'm leaving now for Burlington, Vermont. It will be wild!

Joy Behar, who was fired from her last show for lack of ratings, is even worse on @TheView. We love Barbara!

The The View ABC, once great when headed by Barbara Walters, is now in total freefall. Whoopi Goldberg is terrible. Very sad!

Hillary and her friends! 

Weak & ineffective JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. False advertising!

I have an idea for @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster. Try using your last name and don't be ashamed of it!

SenTedCruz Ted--free legal advice on how to pre-empt the Dems on citizen issue. Go to court now & seek Declaratory Judgment--you will win!

Massive crowd in VT tonight. Venue not big enough. Officials say NO to outside event and sound system. Arrive early!

Man shot inside Paris police station. Just announced that terror threat is at highest level. Germany is a total mess-big crime. GET SMART!

I will be in beautiful Burlington, Vermont, tonight for a rally. Will be great fun. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

It was a very wise move that Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship 18 months ago. Senator John McCain is certainly no friend of Ted!

Macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the S&P last year, plunging 46%. Very disloyal company. Another win for Trump! Boycott.

The failing UnionLeader newspaper in N.H. just sent The Trump Organization a letter asking that we take ads. How stupid, how desperate!

Do you believe that @UnionLeader in NH was demanding ads? Look at enclosed letter from them, just received: 

I will be on @wolfblitzer for a @CNNSitRoom interview today. Please join us 5PM ET.

Huge crowd expected tomorrow night! VT Police say first come, first serve. Arrive early!

Dont like SamuelLJacksons golf swing.  Not athletic. Ive won many club championships. Play him for charity!

I dont cheat at golf but @SamuelLJackson cheatswith his game he has no choiceand stop doing commercials!

HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my son, @EricTrump! Very proud of you! 

Germany is going through massive attacks to its people  by the migrants allowed to enter the country. New Years Eve was a disaster. THINK!

I dont know SamuelLJackson, to best of my knowledge haven't played golf w/him & think he does too many TV commercials boring. Not a fan.

Wow UnionLeader circulation in NH has dropped from 75,000 to around 10bad management. No wonder they begged me for ads.

The rally in Lowell, Massachusetts, was amazing. 10,000 people going wild. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Woody Johnson, owner of the NYJets, is @JebBushs finance chairman. If Woody wouldve been w/me, he wouldve been in the playoffs, at least!

I look forward to being in Lowell, Massachusetts, today. I hear a very big crowd is expected--we will have lots of fun!


By the way, Hillary & the MSM forgot to mention that Hillary is in the  Al-Shabaab terror video. 

The worst thing Hillary could do is have her husband campaign for her. Just watch.

Iran, with all of the money and all else given to them by Obama, has wanted a way to take over Saudi Arabia & their oil. THEY JUST FOUND IT!

Does anybody remember when Bill Clinton, in 2008, worked long and hard for Hillary? She LOST! Now Bill is at it again. Just watch.

Thank you for your support in Biloxi, MS! Let's ALL get out & VOTE in 2016, so we can #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 

Hillary said that guns don't keep you safe. If she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm!

Al-Shabbab, not ISIS, just made a video on me - they all will as front-runner & if I speak out against them, which I must. Hillary lied!

Just returned from Mississippi - a great evening.

Remember, I am self-funding my campaign, the only one in either party. I'm not controlled by lobbyists or special interests-only the U.S.A.!

When I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates, beware - the candidates are mere puppets $$$$!

I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women!

Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president. Jeb Bush is a low energy individual, but Hillary is not much better!

Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL, but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant!

Jeb Bush is a low energy ""stiff"" who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls. Has no chance!

Jeb Bush is a sad case. A total embarrassment to both himself and his family, he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads!

Jeb Bush is a sad case. A total embarrassment to both himself and his family, he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads!

Massive crowds expected in Mississippi tomorrow night. Look forward to it! 

The person that Hillary Clinton least wants to run against is, by far, me. It will be the largest voter turnout ever - she will be swamped!

I have never been interested in politics but because of you I want to get my political science degree. #trump2016""  Great!

I will be going to Mississippi tomorrow night - hear the crowds are going to be massive! Look forward to it.

Well, the year has officially begun. I have many stops planned and will be working very hard to win so that we can turn our country around!

Happy New Year from #MarALago! Thank you to my great family for all of their support. HAPPY NEW YEAR & THANK YOU! 

I will be on FoxNews live,  with members of my family, at 11:50 P.M. We will ring in the New Year together! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I would like to wish everyone A HAPPY AND HEALTHY NEW YEAR. WE MUST ALL WORK TOGETHER TO, FINALLY, MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN AND GREAT AGAIN!

Do you believe that The State Department, on NEW YEAR'S EVE, just released more of Hillary's e-mails. They just want it all to end. BAD!

THANK YOU ILLINOIS! Let's not forget to get family & friends- out to VOTE IN 20

HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my son @DonaldJTrumpJr! Very proud of you! #TBT 

I would feel sorry for @JebBush and how badly he is doing with his campaign other than for the fact he took millions of $'s of hit ads on me

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

People ask "why do you tweet and re-tweet to millions about Jeb Bush when he is so low in the polls?" Because of his big $ hit ads on me!

Jeb Bush has spent  $630000 and is at the bottom of the polls. I have spent almost nothing and am at the top. WIN! 

A GREAT day in South Carolina. Record crowd and fantastic enthusiasm. This is now a movement to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I predict that dying @UnionLeader newspaper which has been run into the ground by publisher "Stinky" Joe McQuaid will be dead in 2 years!

A lovely letter from the daughter of the late great John Wayne. Our country could use a John Wayne right now. 

Great poll- thank you Nevada! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

I'm going to be live with @ericbolling and @kimguilfoyle to ring in the New Year 2016. Everybody should tune in to @foxnews tomorrow night!

I never thought I'd be saying this but I've really enjoyed  RichLowry on television lately and he was terrific.

The dying UnionLeader newspaper in NH is in turmoil over my comments about them- like a bully that got knocked out!

THANK YOU Council Bluffs Iowa! The silent majority is silent no more! #Trump2016 #FITN 

Joe McQuaid of the dying Union Leader wanted ads lunches donations speeches from me and tweets---very unethical.

The great people of New Hampshire who I love are not properly served by the dying Union Leader newspaper.

Shows how dumb Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) of the dying Union Leader is to put out the letter I wrote saying why I didn't do his failed debate!

I hope he does better for Rubio than he did at the #Benghazi hearings which were a total disaster for Republicans & America!

We need a real President! 

Looking forward to being in Council Bluffs Iowa later today. Despite weather rally is on -- will be fantastic! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!

So I have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place. Jeb Bush has spent $59 million & done. Run country my way!

My campaign for president is $350000 under budget I have spent very little (and am in 1st place).Now I will spend big in Iowa/N.H./S.C.

Minorities line up behind.....Donald Trump" #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 

I will be interviewed on the @TODAYshow at 7:00 A.M. Talking about the state of the race for president and more. Enjoy!

Remember that Bill Clinton was brought in to help Hillary against Obama in 2008. He was terrible failed badly and was called a racist!

Thank you to a #Trump2016 supporter for this video of my campaign- over the past 6 months. Video: 

Strange but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes while he will double & triple them a disaster!

Wages in are country are too low good jobs are too few  and people have lost faith in our leaders.We need smart and strong leadership now!

Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone shipped to other countries. We now are part time sad! I WILL FIX!

The middle-class has worked so hard are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no  effective raise in years. BAD

If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband with his terrible record of women abuse while playing the women's card on me she's wrong!

Hopefully the Republican National Committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in Virginia's Republican Party. FAST!

Straighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late. Stupid!  RNC

BernieSanders-who blew his campaign when he gave Hillary a pass on her e-mail crime said that I feel wages in America are too high. Lie!

What's going on in VA? What's the GOP doing?  They will lose the state because of the RNC!

Why are JebBush flunkies Anna Navarro and SE Cupp two of the dumbest people in politics always on the CNN panels.

The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. The Dems LOVE IT! Be smart and win for a change!

R.P.Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. Will now not allow desperately needed new voters. Suicidal mistake. RNC MUST ACT NOW!

It begins Republican Party of Virginia controlled by the RNC is working hard to disallow independent unaffiliated and new voters. BAD!

I will do far more for women than Hillary and I will keep our country safe something which she will not be able to do-no strength/stamina!

Thank you! #Trump2016 

Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM so inappropriate!

If the insurance companies are making lots of money and the # of uninsured is still largeObamacare is a failure since so expensive

A new terror warning was issued for European cties. At what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart. Weak leaders!

Criminal deportations in the U.S. are the lowest number in many years. We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country. MUST CHANGE!

The Phoenix V.A. it has just been reported is in worse shape than ever before. The wait is horrendous and people are dying. I will fix it

The same people that said I wouldn't run or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%) now say I won't beat Hillary.

He is so dishonest in his reporting. And to think he was going off the air until I came along-no ratings. I will beat Hillary!

CNN just announced that TRUMP was #1 story of 2015. Totally meaningless however if we don't WIN IT ALL and Make America Great Again!

When will the Democrats and Hillary in particular say "we must build a wall a great wall and Mexico is going to pay for it?" Never!

Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A. That will stop I will fix this quickly!

Remember when failed candidate @JebBush said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE? He's spent $59 million and is at 3%.

We have many problems in our house (country!) and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now because of me starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!

She gets what is going on in politics and sees it very clearly. Have her on more!

Merry Christmas to all. Have a great day and have a really amazing year. Together we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It will be done!

Great job on CNN today. Very wise indeed!

Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video. Bad reporting. Perhaps @NBC will do better next year-but doubt it!

True a total distortion of the facts!

Very dishonest in not showing the new @CNN Poll where I am at 39% 21points higher than Cruz. Be honest Chuck!

Why isn't Chuck Todd using the much newer CNN Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older poll?

Wow because of the pressure put on by me ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It's about time!

Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton a totally flawed candidate and beating her soundly

Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing New York Times are totally in the Hillary circle of bias. Think about Bill!

Wow even lowly Rand Paul has just past @JebBush in the new @CNN Poll. Jeb is at 3% I'm at 39%. Stop throwing your money down the drain!

In the ridiculous Jeb Bush ad about me Jeb is speaking to me during the debate but doesn't allow my answer which destroys him - SO SAD!

Poor Jeb Bush spent $50 million on his campaign I spent almost nothing. He's bottom (and gone) I'm top (by a lot). That's what U.S. needs!

Hillary said "I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign." I deplore the death and destruction she caused-stupidity

Merry Christmas & Happy Holidays! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Hillary when you complain about "a penchant for sexism who are you referring to. I have great respect for women. BE CAREFUL!

It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media.  New @CNN Poll amazing in ALL categories. 21 pt. Lead

Why does FoxNews give KarlRove so much airtime. He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased. Still thinks Romney won. Unfair coverage of Trump

FoxNews treats me so badly. Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out CNN Poll. All negative!

The @washingtonpost, which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on #Amazon, today did a nasty cartoon attacking @tedcruz kids. Bad

The silent majority- is silent no more! Remember the importance of VOTING! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

The Hillary Clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic. Be careful Hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card.

Thank you America! Together- we will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 

Big news just out - NEW CNN POLL  TRUMP  39 and leads in every major category. Likeability way up. CRUZ 18  CARSON 10  RUBIO 10

We need a PRESIDENT with strength, stamina, heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again!

It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. Sad!

When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama, it meant got beaten badly. The media knows this. Often used word in politics! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 

Wow, new Reuters Poll just out. Big lead if you want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  TRUMP 37  CRUZ 11 This is at the top of Drudge!

For those on TV defending my use of the word "schlonged bc #MSM is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. Dishonest #MSM

Once again, MSM is dishonest. "Schlonged is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got "schlonged" that meant beaten badly.

Jeb's big ad buy against me, paid for by lobbyists, shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements. He is really pathetic!

Watching CNN and consider SE Cupp to be one of the least talented people on television. Boring and biased!

The Donald should've been named Man of the Year. He dominates the polls, news, talk shows & social media. MAGA!



Friends, delegates and fellow Americans: I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.

Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace

We will be a country of generosity and warmth.

But we will also be a country of law and order.

Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation.

The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life

Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.

Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities.

Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims.

I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end.

Beginning on January 20th 2017, safety will be restored.

The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens.

Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead.

It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.

I will present the facts plainly and honestly.

We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.

So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week.

But here, at our convention, there will be no lies.

We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.

Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration‚Äôs rollback of criminal enforcement.

Homicides last year increased by 17% in America‚Äôs fifty largest cities.

That‚Äôs the largest increase in 25 years.

In our nation‚Äôs capital, killings have risen by 50 percent.

They are up nearly 60% in nearby Baltimore.

In the President‚Äôs hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 have been the victims of shootings this year alone.

And more than 3,600 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.

The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50% compared to this point last year.

Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.

The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015.

They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.

One such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska.

There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root.

She was 21 years-old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point Average.

Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law.

I‚Äôve met Sarah‚Äôs beautiful family.

But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn‚Äôt worth protecting.

One more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders.

What about our economy?

Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper: Nearly Four in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African American youth are not employed.

2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when the President took his oath of office less than eight years ago.

Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.

Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000.

Our manufacturing trade deficit has reached an all-time high ‚Äì nearly $800 billion in a single year.

The budget is no better.

President Obama has doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing.

Yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are in Third World condition, and forty-three million Americans are on food stamps.

Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad.

Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they have lived through one international humiliation after another.

We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint.

This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us nothing ‚Äì it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever made.

Another humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria ‚Äì and the whole world knew it meant nothing.

In Libya, our consulate ‚Äì the symbol of American prestige around the globe ‚Äì was brought down in flames.

America is far less safe ‚Äì and the world is far less stable ‚Äì than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America‚Äôs foreign policy.

I am certain it is a decision he truly regrets.

Her bad instincts and her bad judgment ‚Äì something pointed out by Bernie Sanders ‚Äì are what caused the disasters unfolding today.

Let‚Äôs review the record.

In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map.

Libya was cooperating. Egypt was peaceful.

Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence.

Iran was being choked by sanctions.

Syria was under control.

After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region, and the world.

After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region, and the world.

Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers.

Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control.

Iraq is in chaos.

Iraq is in chaos.

Iraq is in chaos.

Iraq is in chaos.

Iraq is in chaos.

Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons

Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis that now threatens the West.

Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis that now threatens the West.

After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before.

This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction and weakness.

This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction and weakness.

But Hillary Clinton‚Äôs legacy does not have to be America‚Äôs legacy

The problems we face now ‚Äì poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad ‚Äì will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them.

A change in leadership!

A change in leadership!

A change in leadership!

Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action for America.

The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America First.

America First!

America First!

America First!

America First!

America First!

Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.

As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect.

This will all change in 2017.

The American People will come first once again.

My plan will begin with safety at home ‚Äì which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism

There can be no prosperity without law and order.

LAW AND ORDER!

LAW AND ORDER!

LAW AND ORDER!

LAW AND ORDER!

LAW AND ORDER!

On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America.

A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation‚Äôs most powerful special interests.

That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit.

Big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place.

They are throwing money at her because they have total control over everything she does.

She is their puppet, and they pull the strings.

That is why Hillary Clinton‚Äôs message is that things will never change.

My message is that things have to change ‚Äì and they have to change right now.

Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned.

I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals.

These are the forgotten men and women of our country.

People who work hard but no longer have a voice.

I AM YOUR VOICE.

I AM YOUR VOICE.

I AM YOUR VOICE.

I AM YOUR VOICE.

I AM YOUR VOICE.

I AM YOUR VOICE.

I AM YOUR VOICE.

I AM YOUR VOICE.

I AM YOUR VOICE.

I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good.

I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.

When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws ‚Äì or worse still, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash ‚Äì I am not able to look the other way.

And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can‚Äôt see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence ‚Äì I know that corruption has reached a level like never before.

When the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù and ‚Äúnegligent,‚Äù in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did.

They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible crimes.

In fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it ‚Äì especially when others have paid so dearly.

When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers I know the time for action has come.

I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves.

Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it.

I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders ‚Äì he never had a chance.

But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest issue: trade.

Millions of Democrats will join our movement because we are going to fix the system so it works for all Americans.

In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana.

We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana.

Mike Pence is a man of character and accomplishment.

Mike Pence is a man of character and accomplishment.

Mike Pence is a man of character and accomplishment.

Mike Pence is a man of character and accomplishment.

Mike Pence is the right man for the job.

Mike Pence is the right man for the job.

Mike Pence is the right man for the job.

Mike Pence is the right man for the job.

The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities.

America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were brutally executed.

In the days after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials.

Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.

More police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

Three were killed, and four were badly injured.

An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans.

I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order our country.

I will work with, and appoint, the best prosecutors and law enforcement officials in the country to get the job done.

In this race for the White House, I am the Law And Order candidate.

The irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment for everyone.

This Administration has failed America‚Äôs inner cities

She's failed them on education

She's failed them on jobs

She's failed them on crime

She's failed them at every level.

She's failed them on education

She's failed them on jobs

She's failed them on crime

She's failed them at every level.

She's failed them on education

She's failed them on jobs

She's failed them on crime

She's failed them at every level.

When I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally.

Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this make life better for young Americans in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child America?

To make life safe in America, we must also address the growing threats we face from outside America: we are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS

Once again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism.

Men, women and children viciously mowed down

Lives ruined.

Families ripped apart.

A nation in mourning.

Lives ruined.

Families ripped apart.

A nation in mourning.

Lives ruined.

Families ripped apart.

A nation in mourning.

The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been over and over ‚Äì at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, and a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist

This time, the terrorist targeted our LGBT community.

As your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBT citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.

To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things.

We must have the best intelligence gathering operation in the world

We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria

Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terror.

This includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel.

Lastly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place.

My opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama.

She proposes this despite the fact that there‚Äôs no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from.

I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people.

Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never will be.

Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers.

We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people.

On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and Jamiel Shaw.

They are just three brave representatives of many thousands.

Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border.

These families have no special interests to represent them.

There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf

My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain

My opponent wants Sanctuary Cities!

My opponent wants Sanctuary Cities!

My opponent wants Sanctuary Cities!

My opponent wants Sanctuary Cities!

My opponent wants Sanctuary Cities!

My opponent wants Sanctuary Cities!

But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, Sabine and Jamiel? Where was sanctuary for all the other Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly?

These wounded American families have been alone.

Tonight, this candidate and this whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering the same awful fate.

We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities.

I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America‚Äôs Border Patrol Agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful immigration system.

By ending catch-and-release on the border, we will stop the cycle of human smuggling and violence

Illegal border crossings will go down.

Peace will be restored!

Peace will be restored!

Peace will be restored!

Peace will be restored!

Peace will be restored!

Peace will be restored!

Peace will be restored!

Peace will be restored!

Peace will be restored!

By enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve.

Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied ‚Äì and every politician who has denied them ‚Äì to listen very closely to the words I am about to say.

On January 21st of 2017, the day after I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced.

We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone.

But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens.

My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton.

Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration.

Communities want relief.

Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness.

Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape from poverty.

I have a different vision for our workers.

It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat.

It‚Äôs been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office.

I have made billions of dollars in business making deals ‚Äì now I‚Äôm going to make our country rich again.

I‚Äôm going to make our country rich again.

I‚Äôm going to make our country rich again.

I‚Äôm going to make our country rich again.

I‚Äôm going to make our country rich again.

I‚Äôm going to make our country rich again.

I‚Äôm going to make our country rich again.

I‚Äôm going to make our country rich again.

I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great ones

America has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton.

Remember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country.

Never again folks.

Never again folks.

Never again folks.

Never again folks.

Never again folks.

Never again folks.

Never again folks.

I am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and to America ‚Äì and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequences.

My opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class.

She supported NAFTA, and she supported China‚Äôs entrance into the World Trade Organization ‚Äì another one of her husband‚Äôs colossal mistakes.

Hillary supported the job killing trade deal with South Korea.

Hillary has supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

The TPP will not only destroy our manufacturing, but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments.

I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers, or that diminishes our freedom and independence.

Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries.

No longer will we enter into these massive deals, with many countries, that are thousands of pages long ‚Äì and which no one from our country even reads or understands.

We are going to enforce all trade violations, including through the use of taxes and tariffs, against any country that cheats.

This includes stopping China‚Äôs outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation.

Our horrible trade agreements with China and many others, will be totally renegotiated.

That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America ‚Äì and we‚Äôll walk away if we don‚Äôt get the deal that we want.

We are going to start building and making things again.

Next comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules.

While Hillary Clinton plans a massive tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has declared for the presidential race this year ‚Äì Democrat or Republican.

Middle-income Americans will experience profound relief, and taxes will be simplified for everyone.

America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world.

Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country.

Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of them all

Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it

We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy

This will produce more than $20 trillion in job creating economic activity over the next four decades.

My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and steel workers of our country out of work ‚Äì that will never happen when I am President

With these new economic policies, trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country.

This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans ‚Äì We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow

This, in turn, will create millions more jobs

We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.

My opponent would rather protect education bureaucrats than serve American children

We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare

You will be able to choose your own doctor again

And we will fix TSA at the airports! We will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we protect, at a massive loss, will be asked to pay their fair share.

We will take care of our great Veterans like they have never been taken care of before

My opponent dismissed the VA scandal as being not widespread ‚Äì one more sign of how out of touch she really is

We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days

The politicians have talked about it, I‚Äôm going to do it

We are also going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our Constitution.

The replacement for Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and principles

This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election

My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment

I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.

At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical community who have been so good to me and so supportive

You have so much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits.

An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views.

I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and protect free speech for all Americans

We can accomplish these great things, and so much else ‚Äì all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again

It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back ‚Äì bigger, and better and stronger than ever before.

In this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy

My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew

I wonder sometimes what he‚Äôd say if he were here to see this tonight.

It‚Äôs because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people

He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also

Then there‚Äôs my mother, Mary

She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded

She was a truly great mother

She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great judge of character.

To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love you are most special to me

I have loved my life in business.

But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country ‚Äì to go to work for all of you

It‚Äôs time to deliver a victory for the American people

But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past.

America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics.

Remember: all of the people telling you that you can‚Äôt have the country you want, are the same people telling you that I wouldn‚Äôt be standing here tonight

No longer can we rely on those elites in media, and politics, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place.

Instead, we must choose to Believe In America

History is watching us now.

It‚Äôs waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong.

My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge

It reads: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm With Her‚Äù

I choose to recite a different pledge.

My pledge reads: ‚ÄúI‚ÄôM WITH YOU ‚Äì THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.‚Äù

I am your voice.

So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I‚Äôm With You, and I will fight for you, and I will win for you.

To all Americans tonight, in all our cities and towns, I make this promise: We Will Make America Strong Again.

We Will Make America Proud Again.

We Will Make America Safe Again.

And We Will Make America Great Again.

THANK YOU.

Today, I am here to talk about three crucial words that should be at the center of our foreign policy: Peace Through Strength.

We want to achieve a stable, peaceful world with less conflict and more common ground.

I am proposing a new foreign policy focused on advancing America‚Äôs core national interests, promoting regional stability, and producing an easing of tensions in the world

This will require rethinking the failed policies of the past.

We can make new friends, rebuild old alliances, and bring new allies into the fold.

I‚Äôm proud to have the support of warfighting generals, active duty military, and the top experts who know both how to win ‚Äì and how to avoid the endless wars we are caught in now

Just yesterday, 88 top Generals and Admirals endorsed my campaign.

In a Trump Administration, our actions in the Middle East will be tempered by realism

The current strategy of toppling regimes, with no plan for what to do the day after, only produces power vacuums that are filled by terrorists.

Gradual reform, not sudden and radical change, should be our guiding objective in that region.

We should work with any country that shares our goal of destroying ISIS and defeating Radical Islamic terrorism, and form new friendships and partnerships based on this mission

We now have an Administration, and a former Secretary of State, who refuse to say Radical Islamic Terrorism.

Immediately after taking office, I will ask my generals to present to me a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy ISIS.

This will require military warfare, but also cyber warfare, financial warfare, and ideological warfare ‚Äì as I laid out in my speech on defeating Radical Islamic terrorism several weeks ago.

Instead of an apology tour, I will proudly promote our system of government and our way of life as the best in the world ‚Äì just like we did in our campaign against communism during the Cold War.

We will show the whole world how proud we are to be American.

At the same time, immigration security is a vital part of our national security.

We only want to admit people to our country who will support our values and love our people.

These are the pillars of a sound national security strategy.

Unlike my opponent, my foreign policy will emphasize diplomacy, not destruction

Hillary Clinton‚Äôs legacy in Iraq, Libya, and Syria has produced only turmoil and suffering

Her destructive policies have displaced millions of people, then she has invited the refugees into the West with no plan to screen them.

Including Veteran healthcare costs, the price of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan could total $6 trillion, according to a report in the Washington Examiner

Yet, after all this money spent and lives lost, Clinton‚Äôs policies as Secretary of State have left the Middle East in more disarray than ever before.

Meanwhile, China has grown more aggressive, and North Korea more dangerous and belligerent

Russia has defied this Administration at every turn

Putin has no respect for President Obama or Hillary Clinton.

Sometimes it has seemed like there wasn‚Äôt a country in the Middle East that Hillary Clinton didn‚Äôt want to invade, intervene or topple

She is trigger-happy and unstable when it comes to war.

Hillary Clinton is just reckless ‚Äì so reckless, in fact, she put her emails on an illegal server that our enemies could easily hack

Then Clinton‚Äôs team used a technology called bleachbit to acid wash her emails

They even took a hammer to some of her 13 phones, to cover her tracks and obstruct justice

These email records were destroyed after she received a subpoena to turn them over.

In the FBI report, she claimed she couldn‚Äôt recall important information on 39 occasions.

She can‚Äôt even remember whether she was trained in classified information, and said she didn‚Äôt even know the letter ‚ÄúC‚Äù means confidential.

If she can‚Äôt remember such crucial events and information, she is unfit to be Commander-in-Chief.

Her conduct is simply disqualifying.

She talks about her experience, but Hillary Clinton‚Äôs only foreign policy experience is ‚Äúfailure.‚Äù Everywhere she got involved, things got worse.

Let‚Äôs look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn-in.

Libya was stable.

Syria was under control.

Egypt was ruled by a secular President and an ally of the United States.

Iraq was experiencing a reduction in violence

The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished.

Iran was being choked off by economic sanctions.

Fast-forward to today

What have the decisions of Obama-Clinton produced?

Libya is in ruins, our ambassador and three other brave Americans are dead, and ISIS has gained a new base of operations.

Syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war

ISIS controls large portions of territory

A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States

And hundreds of thousands are dead.

In Egypt, terrorists have gained a foothold in the Sinai desert, near the Suez Canal, one of the most essential waterways in the world.

Iraq is in chaos, and ISIS is on the loose.

ISIS has spread across the Middle East, and into the West.

Iran, the world‚Äôs largest state sponsor of terrorism, is now flush with $150 billion dollars in cash released by the United States ‚Äì plus another $1.7 billion dollars in cash ransom payments

In other words, our country was blackmailed and extorted into paying this unheard-of amount of money.

Worst of all, the Nuclear deal puts Iran, the number one state sponsor of Radical Islamic terrorism, on a path to nuclear weapons.

This is Hillary Clinton‚Äôs foreign policy legacy.

But that‚Äôs not all

President Obama and Hillary Clinton have also overseen deep cuts in our military, which only invite more aggression from our adversaries.

History shows that when America is not prepared is when the danger is greatest

We want to deter, avoid and prevent conflict through our unquestioned military strength.

Under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, defense spending is on track to fall to its lowest level as a share of the economy since the end of World War II

We currently have the smallest Army since 1940

The Navy is among the smallest it has been since 1915

And the Air Force is the smallest it has been since 1947.

When Ronald Reagan left office, our Navy had 592 ships

When Barack Obama took office, it had 285 ships

Today, the Navy has just 276 ships.

The average Air Force aircraft is 27 years-old

We have 2nd generation B-52 bombers ‚Äì their fathers flew the same plane.

Our Army has been shrinking rapidly, from 553,000 soldiers in 2009 to just 479,000 today.

In 2009, our Marine Corps had 202,000 active Marines

Today, it‚Äôs just 182,000.

Our ship count is below the minimum of 308 that the Navy says is needed to execute its current missions

President Obama plans to reduce the Army to 450,000 troops‚Äîwhich would hamstring our ability to defend the United States.

It takes 22 years on average to field a major new weapons system.

In 2010, the US spent $554 billion on non-war base defense spending.

In the current year, we are spending $548 billion ‚Äì a cut of 10% in real inflation-adjusted dollars

This reduction was done through what is known as the sequester, or automatic defense budget cuts

Under the budget agreement, defense took half of the cuts ‚Äì even though it makes up only one-sixth of the budget.

As soon as I take office, I will ask Congress to fully eliminate the defense sequester and will submit a new budget to rebuild our military.

This will increase certainty in the defense community as to funding, and will allow military leaders to plan for our future defense needs.

As part of removing the defense sequester, I will ask Congress to fully offset the costs of increased military spending

In the process, we will make government leaner and more responsive to the public.

I will ask that savings be accomplished through common sense reforms that eliminate government waste and budget gimmicks ‚Äì and that protect hard-earned benefits for Americans.

Government-wide, improper government payments are estimated to exceed $135 billion per year, and the amount of unpaid taxes is estimated to be as high as $385 billion.

We can also reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy through responsible workforce attrition ‚Äì that is, when employees retire, they can be replaced by a smaller number of new employees.

We can also stop funding programs that are not authorized in law

Congress spent $320 billion last year on 256 expired laws

Removing just 5 percent of that will reduce spending by almost $200 billion over 10 years.

The military will not be exempt either ‚Äì the military bureaucracy will have to be trimmed as well.

Early in my term, I will also be requesting that all NATO nations promptly pay their bills, which many are not doing right now

Only 5 NATO countries, including the United States, are currently meeting the minimum requirement to spend 2% of GDP on defense.

Additionally, I will be respectfully asking countries such as Germany, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia to pay more for the tremendous security we provide them.

Finally, we will have at our disposal additional revenues from unleashing American energy

The Institute for Energy Research cites a "short-run" figure of as much as $36 billion annually from increased energy production.

Using these new funds, I will ask my Secretary of Defense to propose a new defense budget to meet the following long-term goals:

We will build an active Army of around 540,000, as the Army‚Äôs chief of staff has said he needs

We now have only 31 Brigade Combat Teams, or 490,000 troops, and only one-third of combat teams are considered combat-ready.

We will build a Marine Corps based on 36 battalions, which the Heritage Foundation notes is the minimum needed to deal with major contingencies ‚Äì we have 23 now.

We will build a Navy of 350 surface ships and submarines, as recommended by the bipartisan National Defense Panel ‚Äì we have 276 ships now.

And we will build an Air Force of at least 1,200 fighter aircraft, which the Heritage Foundation has shown to be needed to execute current missions ‚Äì we have 1,113 now.

We will also seek to develop a state of the art missile defense system.

Under Obama-Clinton, our ballistic missile defense capability has been degraded at the very moment the US and its allies are facing a heightened missile threat from states like Iran and North Korea

As these potential adversaries grow their missile programs, US military facilities in Asia and the Middle East, as well as our allies, are increasingly in range, with the United States homeland also potentially threatened.

We propose to rebuild the key tools of missile defense, starting with the Navy cruisers that are the foundation of our missile defense capabilities in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East

The Obama-Clinton administration tried repeatedly to remove our cruisers from service, then refused to modernize these aging ships.

We will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the Ballistic Missile Defense capability our nation needs; this will cost around $220 million per modernization as we seek to modernize a significant portion of these 22 ships.

As we expand our Navy toward the goal of 350 ships, we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming years.

Accomplishing this military rebuild will be a fifty-state effort ‚Äîevery state in the union will be able to take part in rebuilding our military and developing the technologies oftomorrow.

In addition, we will improve the Department of Defense‚Äôs cyber capabilities

Hillary Clinton has taught us all how vulnerable we are to cyber hacking.

Which is why one of the first things we must do is to enforce all classification rules, and enforce all laws relating to the handling of classified information.

Hillary Clinton put her emails on a secret server to cover-up her pay-for-play scandals at the State Department

Nothing threatens the integrity of our Democracy more than when government officials put their public office up for sale.

We will also make it a priority to develop defensive and offensive cyber capabilities at our U.S

Cyber Command, and recruit the best and brightest Americans.

One of my first directives after taking office will be asking the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and all relevant federal departments, to conduct a thorough review of United States cyber defenses and identify all vulnerabilities ‚Äì in our power grid, our communications systems, and all vital infrastructure.

I will then ask for a plan to immediately protect those vulnerabilities.

At the same time, we will invest heavily in offensive cyber capabilities to disrupt our enemies, including terrorists who rely heavily on internet communications.

These new investments in cybersecurity, and the modernization of our military, will spur substantial new job creation in the private sector and help create the jobs and technologies of tomorrow.

America must be the world‚Äôs dominant technological powerhouse of the 21st century, and young Americans ‚Äì including in our inner cities ‚Äì should get these new jobs.

We must also ensure that we have the best medical care, education and support for our military service members and their families ‚Äì both when they serve, and when they return to civilian life.

Our debt to our men and women in uniform is eternal.

To all those who have served this nation, I say: I will never let you down.

We will protect those who protect us.

And we will follow their example of unity

We will work across all racial and income lines to create One American Nation.

Together, we will have one great American future.

We will be one people, under one God, saluting one American flag.

America will be a prosperous, generous and inclusive society.

We will discard the failed policies and division of the past, and embrace true American change to rebuild our economy, rebuild our inner cities, and rebuild our country.

Instead, I'm going to deliver a detailed policy address on one of the greatest challenges facing our country today, illegal immigration.

I've just landed having returned from a very important and special meeting with the President of Mexico, a man I like and respect very much

And a man who truly loves his country, Mexico.

And, by the way, just like I am a man who loves my country, the United States.

We agree on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs, cash, guns, and people across our border, and to put the cartels out of business.

We also discussed the great contributions of Mexican-American citizens to our two countries, my love for the people of Mexico, and the leadership and friendship between Mexico and the United States

It was a thoughtful and substantive conversation and it will go on for awhile

And, in the end we're all going to win

Both countries, we're all going to win.

This is the first of what I expect will be many, many conversations

And, in a Trump administration we're going to go about creating a new relationship between our two countries, but it's going to be a fair relationship

We want fairness.

But to fix our immigration system, we must change our leadership in Washington and we must change it quickly.

Sadly, sadly there is no other way

The truth is our immigration system is worse than anybody ever realized

But the facts aren't known because the media won't report on them

The politicians won't talk about them and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up because they are making an absolute fortune

That's the way it is.

Today, on a very complicated and very difficult subject, you will get the truth

The fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful, powerful politicians


When politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following, amnesty, open borders, lower wages

Immigration reform should mean something else entirely

It should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.

But if we're going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and very sensitive issues

For instance, we have to listen to the concerns that working people, our forgotten working people, have over the record pace of immigration and it's impact on their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills and general living conditions.

These are valid concerns expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds, all over

We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate

Sometimes it's just not going to work out

It's our right, as a sovereign nation to chose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us.

Then there is the issue of security

Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws like they have to be enforced

I have met with many of the great parents who lost their children to sanctuary cities and open borders

So many people, so many, many people

So sad

They will be joining me on this stage in a little while and I look forward to introducing, these are amazing, amazing people.

Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration and the administration that causes this horrible, horrible thought process, called Hillary Clinton.

This includes incredible Americans like 21 year old Sarah Root.

The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered Federal custody and then was released into the U.S., think of it, into the U.S community under the policies of the White House Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Weak, weak policies! Weak and foolish policies!

He was released again after the crime, and now he's out there at large

Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top student in her class one day before her death.

Also among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policy was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21-year-old convenience store clerk and a really good guy from Mesa, Arizona

A lot of you have known about Grant. He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary, who had also been released from federal custody, and they knew it was going to happen again.

Another victim is Kate Steinle gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, by an illegal immigrant, deported five previous times. And they knew he was no good.

Donald Trump's complete convention speech, annotated ¬ª

Then there is the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home, 90 years old and defenseless

The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long, who did not meet Obama administration standards for removal

And they knew it was going to happen.

In California, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, a great woman, according to everybody that knew her, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer

Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never, ever deported, despite the fact that everybody wanted him out.

A 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens, in our prisons and jails together, had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names, 25,000.

On top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion dollars a year.

And this is what we get

For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next 10 years, we could provide 1 million at-risk students with a school voucher, which so many people are wanting.

While there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, many, many, this doesn't change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower skilled workers with less education, who compete directly against vulnerable American workers, and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they can ever possibly pay back.

And they're hurting a lot of our people that cannot get jobs under any circumstances.

But these facts are never reported

Instead, the media and my opponent discuss one thing and only one thing, the needs of people living here illegally

In many cases, by the way, they're treated better than our vets.

Not going to happen anymore, folks.

Not going to happen anymore.

The truth is, the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants or however many there may be -- and honestly we've been hearing that number for years

Anyone who tells you that the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in Washington.

Only the out of touch media elites think the biggest problems facing America -- you know this, this is what they talk about, facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who don't have legal status

And, they also think the biggest thing, and you know this, it's not nuclear, and it's not ISIS, it's not Russia, it's not China, it's global warming.

To all the politicians, donors, and special interests, hear these words from me and all of you today

There is only one core issue in the immigration debate, and that issue is the well being of the American people.

Nothing even comes a close second

Hillary Clinton, for instance, talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated, but she's not talking about the American families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable homicide, because of a preventable death, because of murder.

No, she's only talking about families who come here in violation of the law

We will treat everyone living or residing in our country with great dignity

So important.

We will be fair, just, and compassionate to all, but our greatest compassion must be for our American citizens.

Thank you.

President Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders, and you know it better than anybody right here in Arizona

You know it.

President Obama and Hillary Clinton support sanctuary cities.

They support catch and release on the border

they support visa overstays

They support the release of dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, criminals from detention

And, they support unconstitutional executive amnesty.

Hillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare for illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget.

On top of that she promises uncontrolled, low-skilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers, and especially for African-American and Hispanic workers within our country. Our citizens.

Most incredibly, because to me this is unbelievable, we have no idea who these people are, where they come from. I always say Trojan Horse. 

Watch what's going to happen, folks

It's not going to be pretty.

This includes her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees from Syria and that region over a short period of time

And even yesterday, when you were watching the news, you saw thousands and thousands of people coming in from Syria

What is wrong with our politicians, our leaders if we can call them that. 

What the hell are we doing? Hard to believe. Hard to believe

Now that you've heard about Hillary Clinton's plan, about which she has not answered a single question, let me tell you about my plan

And do you notice --

And do you notice all the time for weeks and weeks of debating my plan, debating, talking about it, what about this, what about that

They never even mentioned her plan on immigration because she doesn't want to get into the quagmire

It's a tough one, she doesn't know what she's doing except open borders and let everybody come in and destroy our country by the way.

While Hillary Clinton meets only with donors and lobbyists, my plan was crafted with the input from Federal Immigration offices, very great people

Among the top immigration experts anywhere in this country, who represent workers, not corporations, very important to us.

I also worked with lawmakers, who've led on this issue on behalf of American citizens for many years

And most importantly I've met with the people directly impacted by these policies

So important. All Things Trump. Number one, are you ready? Are you ready?

We will build a great wall along the southern border

And Mexico will pay for the wall. One hundred percent!

And Mexico will pay for the wall. One hundred percent!

And Mexico will pay for the wall. One hundred percent!

And Mexico will pay for the wall. One hundred percent!

And Mexico will pay for the wall. One hundred percent!

And Mexico will pay for the wall. One hundred percent!

They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for it

And they're great people and great leaders but they're going to pay for the wall

On day one, we will begin working on intangible, physical, tall, power, beautiful southern border wall.

We will use the best technology, including above and below ground sensors that's the tunnels

Remember that, above and below.

Above and below ground sensors

Towers, aerial surveillance and manpower to supplement the wall, find and dislocate tunnels and keep out criminal cartels and Mexico you know that, will work with us

I really believe it

Mexico will work with us. I absolutely believe it

And especially after meeting with their wonderful, wonderful president today

I really believe they want to solve this problem along with us, and I'm sure they will.

Number two, we are going to end catch and release

We catch them, oh go ahead. We catch them, go ahead.

Under my administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came.

And they'll be brought great distances

We're not dropping them right across

They learned that. They'd drop them across, right across, and they'd come back

And across.

Then when they flew them to a long distance, all of a sudden that was the end

We will take them great distances. 

But we will take them to the country where they came from, OK?

Number three

Number three, this is the one, I think it's so great

It's hard to believe, people don't even talk about it

Zero tolerance for criminal aliens.

They don't come in here

They don't come in here.

According to federal data, there are at least 2 million, 2 million, think of it, criminal aliens now inside of our country, 2 million people criminal aliens

We will begin moving them out day one

As soon as I take office

Day one

In joint operation with local, state, and federal law enforcement.

Now, just so you understand, the police, who we all respect -- say hello to the police

Boy, they don't get the credit they deserve

I can tell you. They're great people. But the police and law enforcement, they know who these people are. They live with these people. They get mocked by these people. They can't do anything about these people, and they want to. They know who these people are. Day one, my first hour in office, those people are gone.

And you can call it deported if you want. The press doesn't like that term. You can call it whatever the hell you want. They're gone.

Beyond the 2 million, and there are vast numbers of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled, but their days have run out in this country

The crime will stop. They're going to be gone. It will be over.They're going out. They're going out fast.Moving forward.

We will issue detainers for illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings if we even have to do that.

We will terminate the Obama administration's deadly, and it is deadly, non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets, walk around, do whatever they want to do, crime all over the place.

Since 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities

These are individuals encountered or identified by ICE, but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn't have been politically correct.

My plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions to remove criminal aliens immediately

We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities Program

Good program

We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we don't even know about.

Both of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this administration

And those were programs that worked.

This is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction

There's no common sense, there's no brain power in our administration by our leader, or our leaders. None, none, none.

Here‚Äôs an interesting graphic from a study published this summer on voting attitudes among people who heard incumbents use restrictive rhetoric on immigration -- tough enforcement, no amnesty, deportations -- and its affect on their own opinions.

On my first day in office I am also going to ask Congress to pass Kate's Law, named for Kate Steinle.

To ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry receive strong mandatory minimum sentences Strong. And then we get them out.

Another reform I'm proposing is the passage of legislation named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, to law enforcement officers recently killed by a previously deported illegal immigrant.

The Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly, really swiftly, identified and removed

And they will go face, believe me

They're going to go.

We're going to triple the number of ICE deportation officers.

Within ICE I am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice just like Hillary Clinton has evaded justice, OK?

Maybe they'll be able to deport her.

The local police who know every one of these criminals, and they know each and every one by name, by crime, where they live, they will work so fast

And our local police will be so happy that they don't have to be abused by these thugs anymore

There's no great mystery to it, they've put up with it for years, and no finally we will turn the tables and law enforcement and our police will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening mess.

We're also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents.

Who gave me their endorsement, 16,500 gave me their endorsement.

And put more of them on the border instead of behind desks which is good

We will expand the number of border patrol stations significantly.

I've had a chance to spend time with these incredible law enforcement officers, and I want to take a moment to thank them

What they do is incredible. And getting their endorsement means so much to me. More to me really than I can say. First time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate. Number four, block funding for sanctuary cities. We block the funding. We will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths.

Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities.

Number five, cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws.

We will immediately terminate President Obama's two illegal executive amnesties in which he defied federal law and the Constitution to give amnesty to approximately five million illegal immigrants, five million.

And how about all the millions that are waiting on line, going through the process legally? So unfair.

Hillary Clinton has pledged to keep both of these illegal amnesty programs, including the 2014 amnesty which has been blocked by the United States Supreme Court.

Clinton has also pledged to add a third executive amnesty

And by the way, folks, she will be a disaster for our country, a disaster in so many other ways.

And don't forget the Supreme Court of the United States. Don't forget that when you go to vote on November 8. And don't forget your Second Amendment

And don't forget the repeal and replacement of Obamacare.

And don't forget building up our depleted military

And don't forget taking care of our vets

Don't forget our vets

They have been forgotten.

Clinton's plan would trigger a constitutional crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before

In effect, she would be abolishing the lawmaking powers of Congress in order to write her own laws from the Oval Office

And you see what bad judgment she has

She has seriously bad judgment.

Can you imagine? In a Trump administration all immigration laws will be enforced, will be enforced

As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities

But unlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement

And ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs the way their jobs are supposed to be done.

Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation

That is what it means to have laws and to have a country

Otherwise we don't have a country.

Our enforcement priorities will include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges

That is those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays who've come here under this current corrupt administration.

Number six, we are going to suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur.

According to data provided by the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration, and the national interest between 9/11 and the end of 2014, at least 380 foreign born individuals were convicted in terror cases inside the United States

And even right now the largest number of people are under investigation for exactly this that we've ever had in the history of our country.

Our country is a mess

We don't even know what to look for anymore, folks

Our country has to straighten out

And we have to straighten out fast.

The number is likely higher

But the administration refuses to provide this information, even to Congress

As soon as I enter office I am going to ask the Department of State, which has been brutalized by Hillary Clinton, brutalized.

Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to begin a comprehensive review of these cases in order to develop a list of regions and countries from which immigration must be suspended until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put in place.

I call it extreme vetting right? Extreme vetting

I want extreme

It's going to be so tough, and if somebody comes in that's fine but they're going to be good

It's extreme.

And if people don't like it, we've got have a country folks

Got to have a country

Countries in which immigration will be suspended would include places like Syria and Libya

And we are going to stop the tens of thousands of people coming in from Syria

We have no idea who they are, where they come from

There's no documentation

There's no paperwork

It's going to end badly folks

It's going to end very, very badly.

For the price of resettling, one refugee in the United States, 12 could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region

Which I agree with 100 percent

We have to build safe zones and we'll get the money from Gulf states

We don't want to put up the money

We owe almost $20 trillion

Doubled since Obama took office, our national debt.

But we will get the money from Gulf states and others

We'll supervise it

We'll build safe zones which is something that I think all of us want to see.

Another reform, involves new screening tests for all applicants that include, and this is so important, especially if you get the right people

And we will get the right people

An ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.

Thank you

We're very proud of our country

Aren't we? Really? With all it's going through, we're very proud of our country

For instance, in the last five years, we've admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan

And these two countries according to Pew Research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified

That's what they say.

That's what they say

They're justified

Right? And we're admitting them to our country

Applicants will be asked their views about honor killings, about respect for women and gays and minorities

Attitudes on radical Islam, which our President refuses to say and many other topics as part of this vetting procedure

And if we have the right people doing it, believe me, very, very few will slip through the cracks

Hopefully, none.

Follow our daily presidential tracking poll ¬ª

Number seven, we will insure that other countries take their people back when they order them deported.

There are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they've been ordered to leave the United States

Including large numbers of violent criminals, they won't take them back

So we say, OK, we'll keep them

Not going to happen with me, not going to happen with me.

Due to a Supreme Court decision, if these violent offenders cannot be sent home, our law enforcement officers have to release them into your communities.

And by the way, the results are horrific, horrific

There are often terrible consequences, such as Casey Chadwick's tragic death in Connecticut just last year

Yet despite the existence of a law that commands the Secretary of State to stop issuing visas to these countries.

Secretary Hillary Clinton ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance

And, they would comply if we would act properly.

In other words, if we had leaders that knew what they were doing, which we don't.

The result of her misconduct was the release of thousands and thousands of dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home to their countries

Instead we have them all over the place

Probably a couple in this room as a matter of fact, but I hope not.

According to a report for the Boston Globe from the year 2008 to 2014 nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S

communities because their home countries would not, under any circumstances, take them back

Hard to believe with the power we have

Hard to believe.

We're like the big bully that keeps getting beat up

You ever see that? The big bully that keeps getting beat up.

These 13,000 release occurred on Hillary Clinton's watch

She had the power and the duty to stop it cold, and she decided she would not do it.

And, Arizona knows better than most exactly what I'm talking about.

(APPLAUSE)

Those released include individuals convicted of killings, sexual assaults, and some of the most heinous crimes imaginable.

The Boston Globe writes that a Globe review of 323 criminals released in New England from 2008 to 2012 found that as many as 30 percent committed new offenses, including rape, attempted murder, and child molestation

We take them, we take them.

Number eight, we will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system which we need desperately

For years Congress has required biometric entry-exit visa tracking systems, but it has never been completed

The politicians are all talk, no action, never happens

Never happens.

Hillary Clinton, all talk

Unfortunately when there is action it's always the wrong decision

You ever notice? In my administration we will ensure that this system is in place

And, I will tell you, it will be on land, it will be on sea, it will be in air

We will have a proper tracking system.

Approximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never, ever left

Why should the? Nobody's telling them to leave

Stay as long as you want, we'll take care of you.

Beyond violating our laws, visa overstays, pose -- and they really are a big problem, pose a substantial threat to national security

The 9/11 Commission said that this tracking system would be a high priority and would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in august and September in 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the United States expired visas.

And, you know what that would have meant, what that could have meant

Wouldn't that have been wonderful, right? What that could have meant?

Last year alone nearly half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas

Removing these overstays will be a top priority of my administration.

If people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never, ever leave, the Obama-Clinton policy, that's what it is, then we have a completely open border, and we no longer have a country.

We must send a message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforced.

Number nine, we will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet.

We will ensure that E-Verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law, and we will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country.

Immigration law doesn't exist for the purpose of keeping criminals out

It exists to protect all aspects of American life

The work site, the welfare office, the education system, and everything else.

That is why immigration limits are established in the first place

If we only enforced the laws against crime, then we have an open border to the entire world

We will enforce all of our immigration laws.

And the same goes for government benefits

The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that 62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants use some form of cash or non-cash welfare programs like food stamps or housing assistance.

Tremendous costs, by the way, to our country

Tremendous costs

This directly violates the federal public charge law designed to protect the United States Treasury

Those who abuse our welfare system will be priorities for immediate removal.

Number 10, we will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers, the forgotten people

Workers

We're going to take care of our workers.

And by the way, and by the way, we're going to make great trade deals

We're going to renegotiate trade deals

We're going to bring our jobs back home

We're going to bring our jobs back home.

We have the most incompetently worked trade deals ever negotiated probably in the history of the world, and that starts with NAFTA

And now they want to go TPP, one of the great disasters.

We're going to bring our jobs back home

And if companies want to leave Arizona and if they want to leave other states, there's going to be a lot of trouble for them

It's not going to be so easy

There will be consequence

Remember that

There will be consequence

They're not going to be leaving, go to another country, make the product, sell it into the United States, and all we end up with is no taxes and total unemployment

It's not going to happen

There will be consequences.

We've admitted 59 million immigrants to the United States between 1965 and 2015

Many of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country

So true

But we now have an obligation to them and to their children to control future immigration as we are following, if you think, previous immigration waves.

We've had some big waves

And tremendously positive things have happened

Incredible things have happened

To ensure assimilation we want to ensure that it works

Assimilation, an important word

Integration and upward mobility.

Within just a few years immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records

The time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals.

To keep immigration levels measured by population share within historical norms

To select immigrants based on their likelihood of success in U.S

society and their ability to be financially self- sufficient.

We take anybody

Come on in, anybody

Just come on in

Not anymore.

You know, folks, it's called a two-way street

It is a two-way street, right? We need a system that serves our needs, not the needs of others

Remember, under a Trump administration it's called America first

Remember that.

To choose immigrants based on merit

Merit, skill, and proficiency

Doesn't that sound nice? And to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first

And that in particular African- American and Latino workers who are being shut out in this process so unfairly.

And Hillary Clinton is going to do nothing for the African- American worker, the Latino worker

She's going to do nothing

Give me your vote, she says, on November eighth

And then she'll say, so long, see you in four years

That's what it is.

She is going to do nothing

And just look at the past

She's done nothing

She's been there for 35 years

She's done nothing

And I say what do you have to lose? Choose me

Watch how good we're going to do together

Watch.

You watch

We want people to come into our country, but they have to come into our country legally and properly vetted, and in a manner that serves the national interest

We've been living under outdated immigration rules from decades ago

They're decades and decades old.

To avoid this happening in the future, I believe we should sunset our visa laws so that Congress is forced to periodically revise and revisit them to bring them up to date

They're archaic

They're ancient

We wouldn't put our entire federal budget on auto pilot for decades, so why should we do the same for the very, very complex subject of immigration?

SIGN UP for our free Essential Politics newsletter ¬ª

So let's now talk about the big picture

These 10 steps, if rigorously followed and enforced, will accomplish more in a matter of months than our politicians have accomplished on this issue in the last 50 years

It's going to happen, folks

Because I am proudly not a politician, because I am not behold to any special interest, I've spent a lot of money on my campaign, I'll tell you

I write those checks

Nobody owns Trump.

I will get this done for you and for your family

We'll do it right

You'll be proud of our country again

We'll do it right

We will accomplish all of the steps outlined above

And, when we do, peace and law and justice and prosperity will prevail

Crime will go down

Border crossings will plummet

Gangs will disappear.

And the gangs are all over the place

And welfare use will decrease

We will have a peace dividend to spend on rebuilding America, beginning with our American inner cities

We're going to rebuild them, for once and for all.

For those here illegally today, who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only

To return home and apply for reentry like everybody else, under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above

Those who have left to seek entry --

Thank you

Thank you

Those who have left to seek entry under this new system -- and it will be an efficient system -- will not be awarded surplus visas, but will have to apply for entry under the immigration caps or limits that will be established in the future.

We will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration

We will break the cycle

There will be no amnesty.

Our message to the world will be this

You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country

Can't do it.

This declaration alone will help stop the crisis of illegal crossings and illegal overstays, very importantly

People will know that you can't just smuggle in, hunker down and wait to be legalized

It's not going to work that way

Those days are over.

Importantly, in several years when we have accomplished all of our enforcement and deportation goals and truly ended illegal immigration for good, including the construction of a great wall, which we will have built in record time

And at a reasonable cost, which you never hear from the government.

And the establishment of our new lawful immigration system then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain.

That discussion can take place only in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, no longer with us, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time.

Right now, however, we're in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis and a terrorism crisis like never before

All energies of the federal government and the legislative process must now be focused on immigration security

That is the only conversation we should be having at this time, immigration security

Cut it off.

Whether it's dangerous materials being smuggled across the border, terrorists entering on visas or Americans losing their jobs to foreign workers, these are the problems we must now focus on fixing

And the media needs to begin demanding to hear Hillary Clinton's answer on how her policies will affect Americans and their security.

These are matters of life and death for our country and its people, and we deserve answers from Hillary Clinton

And do you notice, she doesn't answer.

She didn't go to Louisiana

She didn't go to Mexico

She was invited.

She doesn't have the strength or the stamina to make America great again

Believe me.

What we do know, despite the lack of media curiosity, is that Hillary Clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement

Just ask the Border Patrol about Hillary Clinton

You won't like what you're hearing.

The result will be millions more illegal immigrants; thousands of more violent, horrible crimes; and total chaos and lawlessness

That's what's going to happen, as sure as you're standing there.

This election, and I believe this, is our last chance to secure the border, stop illegal immigration and reform our laws to make your life better

I really believe this is it

This is our last time

Thank you.

These are amazing people, and I am not asking for their endorsement, believe me that

I just think I've gotten to know so many of them, and many more, from our group

But they are incredible people and what they're going through is incredible, and there's just no reason for it

Let's give them a really tremendous hand.

That's tough stuff, I will tell you

That is tough stuff

Incredible people.

So, now is the time for these voices to be heard

Now is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf

Now is the time for all of us as one country, Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative to band together to deliver justice, and safety, and security for all Americans.

Let's fix this horrible, horrible, problem

It can be fixed quickly

Let's our secure our border.

Let's stop the drugs and the crime from pouring into our country

Let's protect our social security and Medicare

Let's get unemployed Americans off the welfare and back to work in their own country.

This has been an incredible evening

We're going to remember this evening

November 8, we have to get everybody

This is such an important state

November 8 we have to get everybody to go out and vote.

We're going to bring -- thank you, thank you

We're going to take our country back, folks

This is a movement

We're going to take our country back.

Thank you.

Thank you.

This is an incredible movement

The world is talking about it

The world is talking about it and by the way, if you haven't been looking to what's been happening at the polls over the last three or four days I think you should start looking

You should start looking.

Together we can save American lives, American jobs, and American futures

Together we can save America itself

Join me in this mission, we're going to make America great again.

It is great to be with you this afternoon.

Today we begin a conversation about how to Make America Safe Again.

In the 20th Century, the United States defeated Fascism, Nazism, and Communism.

Now, a different threat challenges our world: Radical Islamic Terrorism.

This summer, there has been an ISIS attack launched outside the war zones of the Middle East every 84 hours.

Here, in America, we have seen one brutal attack after another.

13 were murdered, and 38 wounded, in the assault on Ft

Hood.

The Boston Marathon Bombing wounded and maimed 264 people, and ultimately left five dead ‚Äì including 2 police officers.

In Chattanooga, Tennessee, five unarmed marines were shot and killed at a military recruiting center.

Last December, 14 innocent Americans were gunned down at an office party in San Bernardino, another 22 were injured.

In June, 49 Americans were executed at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, and another 53 were injured

It was the worst mass shooting in our history, and the worst attack on the LGTBQ community in our history.

In Europe, we have seen the same carnage and bloodshed inflicted upon our closest allies.

In January of 2015, a French satirical newspaper, Charlie Hebdo, was attacked for publishing cartoons of the prophet Mohammed

Twelve were killed, including two police officers, and 11 were wounded

Two days later, four were murdered in a Jewish Deli.

In November of 2015, terrorists went on a shooting rampage in Paris that slaughtered 130 people, and wounded another 368

France is suffering gravely, and the tourism industry is being massively affected in a most negative way.

In March of this year, terrorists detonated a bomb in the Brussels airport, killing 32 and injuring 340.

This July, in the South of France, an Islamic terrorist turned his truck into an instrument of mass murder, plowing down and killing 85 men, women and children ‚Äì and wounding another 308

Among the dead were 2 Americans ‚Äì a Texas father, and his 11-year-old son.

A few weeks ago, in Germany, a refugee armed with an axe wounded five people in a gruesome train attack.

Only days ago, an ISIS killer invaded a Christian church in Normandy France, forced an 85-year-old priest to his knees, and slit his throat before his congregation.

Overseas, ISIS has carried out one unthinkable atrocity after another

Children slaughtered, girls sold into slavery, men and women burned alive.

Crucifixions, beheadings and drownings

Ethnic minorities targeted for mass execution

Holy sites desecrated

Christians driven from their homes and hunted for extermination

ISIS rounding-up what it calls the ‚Äúnation of the cross‚Äù in a campaign of genocide

We cannot let this evil continue.

Nor can we let the hateful ideology of Radical Islam ‚Äì its oppression of women, gays, children, and nonbelievers ‚Äì be allowed to reside or spread within our own countries.

We will defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism, just as we have defeated every threat we have faced in every age before.

But we will not defeat it with closed eyes, or silenced voices.

Anyone who cannot name our enemy, is not fit to lead this country

Anyone who cannot condemn the hatred, oppression and violence of Radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our President.

The rise of ISIS is the direct result of policy decisions made by President Obama and Secretary Clinton.

Let‚Äôs look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009, before the Obama-Clinton Administration took over.

Libya was stable.

Syria was under control.

Egypt was ruled by a secular President and an ally of the United States.

Iraq was experiencing a reduction in violence.

The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished.

Iran was being choked off by economic sanctions.

Fast-forward to today

What have the decisions of Obama-Clinton produced?

Libya is in ruins, our ambassador and three other brave Americans are dead, and ISIS has gained a new base of operations.

Syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war

ISIS controls large portions of territory

A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States.

In Egypt, terrorists have gained a foothold in the Sinai desert, near the Suez Canal, one of the most essential waterways in the world.

Iraq is in chaos, and ISIS is on the loose.

ISIS has spread across the Middle East, and into the West

In 2014, ISIS was operating in some 7 nations

Today they are fully operational in 18 countries with aspiring branches in 6 more, for a total of 24 ‚Äì and many believe it is even more than that

The situation is likely worse than the public knows: a new Congressional report reveals that the Administration has downplayed the growth of ISIS, with 40% of analysts saying they had experienced efforts to manipulate their findings.

At the same time, ISIS is trying to infiltrate refugee flows into Europeand the United States.

Iran, the world‚Äôs largest state sponsor of terrorism, is now flush with $150 billion in cash released by the United States ‚Äì plus another $400 million in ransom

Worst of all, the Nuclear deal puts Iran, the number one state sponsor of Radical Islamic Terrorism, on a path to nuclear weapons.

In short, the Obama-Clinton foreign policy has unleashed ISIS, destabilized the Middle East, and put the nation of Iran ‚Äì which chants ‚ÄòDeath to America‚Äô ‚Äì in a dominant position of regional power and, in fact, aspiring to be a dominant world power.

It all began in 2009 with what has become known as President Obama‚Äôs global ‚ÄòApology Tour.‚Äô

In a series of speeches, President Obama described America as ‚Äúarrogant,‚Äù ‚Äúdismissive‚Äù ‚Äúderisive‚Äù and a ‚Äúcolonial power.‚Äù He informed other countries that he would be speaking up about America‚Äôs ‚Äúpast errors.‚Äù He pledged that we would no longer be a ‚Äúsenior partner,‚Äù that ‚Äúsought to dictate our terms.‚Äù He lectured CIA officers of the need to acknowledge their mistakes, and described Guantanamo Bay as a ‚Äúrallying cry for our enemies.‚Äù

Perhaps no speech was more misguided than President Obama‚Äôs speech to the Muslim World delivered in Cairo, Egypt, in 2009.

In winning the Cold War, President Ronald Reagan repeatedly touted the superiority of freedom over communism, and called the USSR the Evil Empire.

Yet, when President Obama delivered his address in Cairo, no such moral courage could be found

Instead of condemning the oppression of women and gays in many Muslim nations, and the systematic violations of human rights, or the financing of global terrorism, President Obama tried to draw an equivalency between our human rights record and theirs.

His na√Øve words were followed by even more na√Øve actions.

The failure to establish a new Status of Forces Agreement in Iraq, and the election-driven timetable for withdrawal, surrendered our gains in that country and led directly to the rise of ISIS.

The failures in Iraq were compounded by Hillary Clinton‚Äôs disaster in Libya

President Obama has since said he regards Libya as his worst mistake

According to then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, the invasion of Libya was nearly a split decision, but Hillary Clinton‚Äôs forceful advocacy for the intervention was the deciding factor.

With one episode of bad judgment after another, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs policies launched ISIS onto the world.

Yet, as she threw the Middle East into violent turmoil, things turned out well for her

The Clintons made almost $60 million in gross income while she was Secretary of State.

Incident after incident proves again and again: Hillary Clinton lacks the judgement, the temperament and the moral character to lead this nation

Importantly, she also lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on ISIS, and all the many adversaries we face ‚Äì not only in terrorism, but in trade and every other challenge we must confront to turn this country around.

It is time for a new approach.

Our current strategy of nation-building and regime change is a proven failure

We have created the vacuums that allow terrorists to grow and thrive.

I was an opponent of the Iraq war from the beginning ‚Äì a major difference between me and my opponent.

Though I was a private citizen, whose personal opinions on such matters was not sought, I nonetheless publicly expressed my private doubts about the invasion

Three months before the invasion I said, in an interview with Neil Cavuto, to whom I offer my best wishes for a speedy recovery, that ‚Äúperhaps [we] shouldn‚Äôt be doing it yet,‚Äù and that ‚Äúthe economy is a much bigger problem.‚Äù

In August of 2004, very early in the conflict, I made a detailed statement to Esquire magazine

Here is the quote in full:

‚ÄúLook at the war in Iraq and the mess that we‚Äôre in

I would never have handled it that way

Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country? C‚Äômon

Two minutes after we leave, there‚Äôs going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over

And he‚Äôll have weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam didn‚Äôt have.

‚ÄúWhat was the purpose of this whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed

And what about the people coming back with no arms and legs? Not to mention the other side

All those Iraqi kids who‚Äôve been blown to pieces

And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong

All this for nothing.‚Äù

So I have been clear for a long time that we should not have gone in

But I have been just as clear in saying what a catastrophic mistake Hillary Clinton and President Obama made with the reckless way in which they pulled out.

After we had made those hard-fought sacrifices and gains, we should never have made such a sudden withdrawal ‚Äì on a timetable advertised to our enemies

Al Qaeda in Iraq had been decimated, and Obama and Clinton gave it new life and allowed it to spread across the world.

By that same token, President Obama and Hillary Clinton should never have attempted to build a Democracy in Libya, to push for immediate regime change in Syria or to support the overthrow of Mubarak in Egypt.

One more point on this: I have long said that we should have kept the oil in Iraq ‚Äì another area where my judgement has been proven correct

According to CNN, ISIS made as much $500 million in oil sales in 2014 alone, fueling and funding its reign of terror

If we had controlled the oil, we could have prevented the rise of ISIS in Iraq ‚Äì both by cutting off a major source of funding, and through the presence of U.S

forces necessary to safeguard the oil and other vital infrastructure

I was saying this constantly and to whoever would listen: keep the oil, keep the oil, keep the oil, I said ‚Äì don‚Äôt let someone else get it.

If they had listened to me then, we would have had the economic benefits of the oil, which I wanted to use to help take care of the wounded soldiers and families of those who died ‚Äì and thousands of lives would have been saved.

This proposal, by its very nature, would have left soldiers in place to guard our assets

In the old days, when we won a war, to the victor belonged the spoils

Instead, all we got from Iraq ‚Äì and our adventures in the Middle East ‚Äì was death, destruction and tremendous financial loss.

But it is time to put the mistakes of the past behind us, and chart a new course.

If I become President, the era of nation-building will be ended

Our new approach, which must be shared by both parties in America, by our allies overseas, and by our friends in the Middle East, must be to halt the spread of Radical Islam.

All actions should be oriented around this goal, and any country which shares this goal will be our ally

We cannot always choose our friends, but we can never fail to recognize our enemies.

As President, I will call for an international conference focused on this goal

We will work side-by-side with our friends in the Middle East, including our greatest ally, Israel

We will partner with King Abdullah of Jordan, and President Sisi of Egypt, and all others who recognize this ideology of death that must be extinguished.

We will also work closely with NATO on this new mission

I had previously said that NATO was obsolete because it failed to deal adequately with terrorism; since my comments they have changed their policy and now have a new division focused on terror threats.

I also believe that we could find common ground with Russia in the fight against ISIS

They too have much at stake in the outcome in Syria, and have had their own battles with Islamic terrorism.

My Administration will aggressively pursue joint and coalition military operations to crush and destroy ISIS, international cooperation to cutoff their funding, expanded intelligence sharing, and cyberwarfare to disrupt and disable their propaganda and recruiting

We cannot allow the internet to be used as a recruiting tool, and for other purposes, by our enemy ‚Äì we must shut down their access to this form of communication, and we must do so immediately.

Unlike Hillary Clinton, who has risked so many lives with her careless handling of sensitive information, my Administration will not telegraph exact military plans to the enemy

I have often said that General MacArthur and General Patton would be in a state of shock if they were alive today to see the way President Obama and Hillary Clinton try to recklessly announce their every move before it happens ‚Äì like they did in Iraq ‚Äì so that the enemy can prepare and adapt.

The fight will not be limited to ISIS

We will decimate Al Qaeda, and we will seek to starve funding for Iran-backed Hamas and Hezbollah

We can use existing UN Security Council resolutions to apply new sanctions.

Military, cyber and financial warfare will all be essential in dismantling Islamic terrorism.

But we must use ideological warfare as well.

Just as we won the Cold War, in part, by exposing the evils of communism and the virtues of free markets, so too must we take on the ideology of Radical Islam.

While my opponent accepted millions of dollars in Foundation donations from countries where being gay is an offense punishable by prison or death, my Administration will speak out against the oppression of women, gays and people of different faith.

Our Administration will be a friend to all moderate Muslim reformers in the Middle East, and will amplify their voices.

This includes speaking out against the horrible practice of honor killings, where women are murdered by their relatives for dressing, marrying or acting in a way that violates fundamentalist teachings.

Over 1,000 Pakistani girls are estimated to be the victims of honor killings by their relatives each year

Recently, a prominent Pakistani social media star was strangled to death by her brother on the charge of dishonoring the family

In his confession, the brother took pride in the murder and said: ‚ÄúGirls are born to stay home and follow traditions.‚Äù

Shockingly, this is a practice that has reached our own shores.

One such case involves an Iraqi immigrant who was sentenced to 34 years in jail for running over his own daughter claiming she had become ‚Äútoo Westernized.‚Äù

To defeat Islamic terrorism, we must also speak out forcefully against a hateful ideology that provides the breeding ground for violence and terrorism to grow.

A new immigration policy is needed as well.

The common thread linking the major Islamic terrorist attacks that have recently occurred on our soil ‚Äì 9/11, the Ft

Hood shooting, the Boston Bombing, the San Bernardino attack, the Orlando attack ‚Äì is that they have involved immigrants or the children of immigrants.

Clearly, new screening procedures are needed.

A review by the U.S

Senate Immigration Subcommittee has identified 380 foreign-born individuals charged with terrorism or terrorismrelated offenses between 9/11 and 2014, and many more since then.

We also know that ISIS recruits refugees after their entrance into the country ‚Äì as we have seen with the Somali refugee population in Minnesota.

Beyond terrorism, as we have seen in France, foreign populations have brought their anti-Semitic attitudes with them.

Pew polling shows that in many of the countries from which we draw large numbers of immigrants, extreme views about religion ‚Äì such as the death penalty for those who leave the faith ‚Äì are commonplace.

A Trump Administration will establish a clear principle that will govern all decisions pertaining to immigration: we should only admit into this country those who share our values and respect our people.

In the Cold War, we had an ideological screening test

The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today.

In addition to screening out all members or sympathizers of terrorist groups, we must also screen out any who have hostile attitudes towards our country or its principles ‚Äì or who believe that Sharia law should supplant American law.

Those who do not believe in our Constitution, or who support bigotry and hatred, will not be admitted for immigration into the country.

Only those who we expect to flourish in our country ‚Äì and to embrace a tolerant American society ‚Äì should be issued visas.

To put these new procedures in place, we will have to temporarily suspend immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world that have a history of exporting terrorism.

As soon as I take office, I will ask the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security to identify a list of regions where adequate screening cannot take place

We will stop processing visas from those areas until such time as it is deemed safe to resume based on new circumstances or new procedures.

The size of current immigration flows are simply too large to perform adequate screening.

We admit about 100,000 permanent immigrants from the Middle East every year

Beyond that, we admit hundreds of thousands of temporary workers and visitors from the same regions

If we don‚Äôt control the numbers, we can‚Äôt perform adequate screening.

By contrast, my opponent wants to increase the flow of Syrian refugees by 550% percent.

The United States Senate Subcommittee on Immigration estimates that Hillary Clinton‚Äôs plan would mean roughly 620,000 refugees from all current refugee-sending nations in her first term, assuming no cuts to other refugee programs

This would be additional to all other nonrefugee immigration.

The Subcommittee estimates her plan would impose a lifetime cost of roughly $400 billion when you include the costs of healthcare, welfare, housing, schooling, and all other entitlement benefits that are excluded from the State Department‚Äôs placement figures.

In short, Hillary Clinton wants to be America‚Äôs Angela Merkel, and you know what a disaster this massive immigration has been to Germany and the people of Germany ‚Äì crime has risen to levels that no one thought would they would ever see

We have enough problems in our country, we don‚Äôt need another one.

Finally, we will need to restore common sense to our security procedures.

Another common feature of the past attacks that have occurred on our soil is that warning signs were ignored.

The 9/11 hijackers had fraud all over their visa applications.

The Russians warned us about the Boston Bombers, here on political asylum, and the attackers were even twice interviewed by the FBI.

The female San Bernardino shooter, here on a fianc√© visa from Saudi Arabia, wrote of her support for Jihad online

A neighbor saw suspicious behavior but didn‚Äôt warn authorities, because said they didn‚Äôt want to be accused of racially profiling ‚Äì now many are dead and gravely wounded.

The shooter in Orlando reportedly celebrated in his classroom after 9/11

He too was interviewed by the FBI

His father, a native of Afghanistan, supported the oppressive Taliban regime, and expressed anti-American views ‚Äì and by the way, was just seen sitting behind Hillary Clinton with a big smile on his face all the way through her speech

He obviously liked what she had to say.

The Ft

Hood Shooter delivered a presentation to a room full of mental health experts before the attacks in which he threw out one red flag after another

He even proclaimed that ‚Äúwe love death more than you love life!‚Äù

These warnings signs were ignored because political correctness has replaced common sense in our society.

That is why one of my first acts as President will be to establish a Commission on Radical Islam ‚Äì which will include reformist voices in the Muslim community who will hopefully work with us

We want to build bridges and erase divisions.

The goal of the commission will be to identify and explain to the American public the core convictions and beliefs of Radical Islam, to identify the warning signs of radicalization, and to expose the networks in our society that support radicalization.

This commission will be used to develop new protocols for local police officers, federal investigators, and immigration screeners.

We will also keep open Guantanamo Bay, and place a renewed emphasis on human intelligence

Drone strikes will remain part of our strategy, but we will also seek to capture high-value targets to gain needed information to dismantle their organizations

Foreign combatants will be tried in military commissions.

Finally, we will pursue aggressive criminal or immigration charges against anyone who lends material support to terrorism

Similar to the effort to take down the mafia, this will be the understood mission of every federal investigator and prosecutor in the country.

To accomplish a goal, you must state a mission: the support networks for Radical Islam in this country will be stripped out and removed one by one.

Immigration officers will also have their powers restored: those who are guests in our country that are preaching hate will be asked to return home.

To Make America Safe Again, We Must Work Together Again.

Our victory in the Cold War relied on a bipartisan and international consensus

That is what we must have to defeat Radical Islamic terrorism.

But just like we couldn‚Äôt defeat communism without acknowledging that communism exists ‚Äì or explaining its evils ‚Äì we can‚Äôt defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism unless we do the same.

This also means we have to promote the exceptional virtues of our own way of life ‚Äì and expecting that newcomers to our society do the same.

Pride in our institutions, our history and our values should be taught by parents and teachers, and impressed upon all who join our society.

Assimilation is not an act of hostility, but an expression of compassion

Our system of government, and our American culture, is the best in the world and will produce the best outcomes for all who adopt it.

This approach will not only make us safer, but bring us closer together as a country.

Renewing this spirit of Americanism will help heal the divisions in our country

It will do so by emphasizing what we have in common ‚Äì not what pulls us apart.

This is my pledge to the American people: as your President I will be your greatest champion

I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally

We will reject bigotry and oppression in all its forms, and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American people.

Only this way, will we make America Great Again and Safe Again ‚Äì For Everyone.

Thank you

It‚Äôs great to be here in Charlotte

I just met with our many amazing employees right up the road at our property.

I‚Äôd like to take a moment to talk about the heartbreak and devastation in Louisiana, a state that is very special to me.

We are one nation

When one state hurts, we all hurt ‚Äì and we must all work together to lift each other up

Working, building, restoring together.

Our prayers are with the families who have lost loved ones, and we send them our deepest condolences

Though words cannot express the sadness one feels at times like this, I hope everyone in Louisiana knows that our country is praying for them and standing with them to help them in these difficult hours.

We are one country, one people, and we will have together one great future.

Tonight, I‚Äôd like to talk about the New American Future we are going to create together.

Last week, I laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country.

On Monday, I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism.

On Tuesday, in Wisconsin, I talked about how we are going to restore law and order to this country.

Let me take this opportunity to extend our thanks and our gratitude to the police and law enforcement officers in this country who have sacrificed so greatly in these difficult times.

The chaos and violence on our streets, and the assaults on law enforcement, are an attack against all peaceful citizens

If I am elected President, this chaos and violence will end ‚Äì and it will end very quickly.

Every single citizen in our land has a right to live in safety.

To be one united nation, we must protect all of our people

But we must also provide opportunities for all of our people.

We cannot make America Great Again if we leave any community behind.

Nearly Four in ten African-American children are living in poverty.I will not rest until children of every color in this country are fully included in the American Dream.

Jobs, safety, opportunity

Fair and equal representation

This is what I promise to African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and all Americans.

But to achieve this New American Future we must break from the failures of the past.

As you know, I am not a politician

I have worked in business, creating jobs and rebuilding neighborhoods my entire adult life

I‚Äôve never wanted to learn the language of the insiders, and I‚Äôve never been politically correct ‚Äì it takes far too much time, and can often make more difficult.

Sometimes, in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don‚Äôt choose the right words or you say the wrong thing

I have done that, and I regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain

Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues.

But one thing I can promise you is this: I will always tell you the truth.

I speak the truth for all of you, and for everyone in this country who doesn‚Äôt have a voice.

I speak the truth on behalf of the factory worker who lost his or her job.

I speak the truth on behalf of the Veteran who has been denied the medical care they need ‚Äì and so many are not making it

They are dying.

I speak the truth on behalf of the family living near the border that deserves to be safe in their own country but is instead living with no security at all.

Our campaign is about representing the great majority of Americans ‚Äì Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Conservatives and Liberals ‚Äì who read the newspaper, or turn on the TV, and don‚Äôt hear anyone speaking for them

All they hear are insiders fighting for insiders.

These are the forgotten men and women in our society, and they are angry at so much on so many levels

The poverty, the unemployment, the failing schools, the jobs moving to other countries.

I am fighting for these forgotten Americans.

Fourteen months ago, I declared my campaign for the Presidency on the promise to give our government back to the people

Every day since then, I‚Äôve worked to repay the loyalty and the faith that you have put in me.

Every day I think about how much is at stake for this country

This isn‚Äôt just the fight of my life, it‚Äôs the fight of our lives ‚Äì together ‚Äì to save our country.

I refuse to let another generation of American children be excluded from the American Dream

Our whole country loses when young people of limitless potential are denied the opportunity to contribute their talents because we failed to provide them the opportunities they deserved

Let our children be dreamers too.

Our whole country loses every time a kid doesn‚Äôt graduate from high school, or fails to enter the workforce or, worse still, is lost to the dreadful world of drugs and crime.

When I look at the failing schools, the terrible trade deals, and the infrastructure crumbling in our inner cities, I know all of this can be fixed - and it can be fixed very quickly.

In the world I come from, if something is broken, you fix it.

If something isn‚Äôt working, you replace it.

If a product doesn‚Äôt deliver, you make a change.

I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.

That‚Äôs why I am running: to end the decades of bitter failure and to offer the American people a new future of honesty, justice and opportunity

A future where America, and its people, always ‚Äì and I mean always ‚Äì come first.

Aren‚Äôt you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense?

Aren‚Äôt you tired of the same old lies and the same old broken promises? And Hillary Clinton has proven to be one of the greatest liars of all time.

Aren‚Äôt you tired of arrogant leaders who look down on you, instead of serving and protecting you?

That is all about to change ‚Äì and it‚Äôs about to change soon

We are going to put the American people first again.

I‚Äôve travelled all across this country laying out my bold and modern agenda for change.

In this journey, I will never lie to you

I will never tell you something I do not believe

I will never put anyone‚Äôs interests ahead of yours.

And, I will never, ever stop fighting for you.

I have no special interest

I am spending millions of dollars on my own campaign ‚Äì nobody else is.

My only interest is the American people.

So while sometimes I can be too honest, Hillary Clinton is the exact opposite: she never tells the truth

One lie after another, and getting worse each passing day.

The American people are still waiting for Hillary Clinton to apologize for all of the many lies she‚Äôs told to them, and the many times she‚Äôs betrayed them.

Tell me, has Hillary Clinton ever apologized for lying about her illegal email server and deleting 33,000 emails?

Has Hillary Clinton apologized for turning the State Department into a pay-for-play operation where favors are sold to the highest bidder?

Has she apologized for lying to the families who lost loved ones at Benghazi?

Has she apologized for putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons?

Has she apologized for Iraq? For Libya? For Syria? Has she apologized for unleashing ISIS across the world?

Has Hillary Clinton apologized for the decisions she made that have led to so much death, destruction and terrorism?

Speaking of lies, we now know from the State Department announcement that President Obama lied about the $400 million dollars in cash that was flown to Iran

He denied it was for the hostages, but it was

He said we don‚Äôt pay ransom, but he did

He lied about the hostages ‚Äì openly and blatantly ‚Äì just like he lied about Obamacare.

Now the Administration has put every American travelling overseas, including our military personnel, at greater risk of being kidnapped

Hillary Clinton owns President Obama‚Äôs Iran policy, one more reason she can never be allowed to be President.

Let‚Äôs talk about the economy

Here, in this beautiful state, so many people have suffered because of NAFTA

Bill Clinton signed the deal, and Hillary Clinton supported it

North Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA went into effect.

Bill Clinton also put China into the World Trade Organization ‚Äì another Hillary Clinton-backed deal

Your city of Charlotte has lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China joined the WTO, and many of these jobs were lost while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State ‚Äì our chief diplomat with China

She was a disaster, totally unfit for the job.

Hillary Clinton owes the State of North Carolina a very big apology, and I think you‚Äôll get that apology around the same time you‚Äôll get to see her 33,000 deleted emails.

Another major issue in this campaign has been the border

Our open border has allowed drugs and crime and gangs to pour into our communities

So much needless suffering, so much preventable death

I‚Äôve spent time with the families of wonderful Americans whose loved ones were killed by the open borders and Sanctuary Cities that Hillary Clinton supports.

I‚Äôve embraced the crying parents who‚Äôve lost their children to violence spilling across our border

Parents like Laura Wilkerson and Michelle Root and Sabine Durden and Jamiel Shaw whose children were killed by illegal immigrants.

My opponent supports Sanctuary Cities.

But where was the Sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was the Sanctuary for the children of Laura, Michelle, Sabine and Jamiel?

Where was the Sanctuary for every other parent who has suffered so horribly?

These moms and dads don‚Äôt get a lot of consideration from our politicians

They certainly don‚Äôt get apologies

They‚Äôll never even get the time of day from Hillary Clinton.

But they will always come first to me.

Listen closely: we will deliver justice for all of these American Families

We will create a system of immigration that makes us all proud.

Hillary Clinton‚Äôs mistakes destroy innocent lives, sacrifice national security, and betray the working families of this country.

Please remember this: I will never put personal profit before national security

I will never leave our border open to appease donors and special interests

I will never support a trade deal that kills American jobs

I will never put the special interests before the national interest

I will never put a donor before a voter, or a lobbyist before a citizen.

Instead, I will be a champion for the people.

The establishment media doesn‚Äôt cover what really matters in this country, or what‚Äôs really going on in people‚Äôs lives

They will take words of mine out of context and spend a week obsessing over every single syllable, and then pretend to discover some hidden meaning in what I said.

Just imagine for a second if the media spent this energy holding the politicians accountable who got innocent Americans like Kate Steinle killed ‚Äì she was gunned down by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times.

Just imagine if the media spent this much time investigating the poverty and joblessness in our inner cities.

Just think about how much different things would be if the media in this country sent their cameras to our border, or to our closing factories, or to our failing schools

Or if the media focused on what dark secrets must be hidden in the 33,000 emails Hillary Clinton deleted.

Instead, every story is told from the perspective of the insiders

It‚Äôs the narrative of the people who rigged the system, never the voice of the people it‚Äôs been rigged against.

So many people suffering in silence

No cameras, no coverage, no outrage from a media class that seems to get outraged over just about everything else.

So again, it‚Äôs not about me

It‚Äôs never been about me

It‚Äôs about all the people in this country who don‚Äôt have a voice.

I am running to be their voice.

I am running to be the voice for every forgotten part of this country that has been waiting and hoping for a better future.

I am glad that I make the powerful a little uncomfortable now and again ‚Äì including some powerful people in my own party

Because it means I am fighting for real change.

There‚Äôs a reason the hedge fund managers, the financial lobbyists, the Wall Street investors, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton

Because they know she will make sure the system stays rigged in their favor.

It‚Äôs the powerful protecting the powerful.

The insiders fighting for the insiders.

I am fighting for you.

Here is the change I propose.

On terrorism, we are going to end the era of nation-building and instead focus on destroying ISIS and Radical Islamic terrorism.

We will use military, cyber and financial warfare and work with any partner in the world, and the Middle East, that shares our goal of defeating terrorism

I have a message for the terrorists trying to kill our citizens: we will find you, we will destroy you, and we will win.

On immigration, we will temporarily suspend immigration from any place where adequate screening cannot be performed

All applicants for immigration will be vetted for ties to radical ideology, and we will screen out anyone who doesn‚Äôt share our values and love our people

Anyone who believes Sharia law supplants American law will not be given an immigrant visa

If you want to join our society, then you must embrace our society, our values and our tolerant way of life

Those who believe in oppressing women, gays, Hispanics, African-Americans and people of different faiths are not welcome to join our country.

We will promote our America values, our American way of life, and our American system of government which are all the best in the world.

My opponent on the other hand wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees

Her plan would bring in roughly 620,000 refugees from all refugee-sending nations in her first term, on top of all other immigration

Hillary Clinton is running to be America‚Äôs Angela Merkel, and we‚Äôve seen how much crime and how many problems that‚Äôs caused the German people.

We have enough problems already, we don‚Äôt need another one.

On crime, we are going to add more police, more investigators, and appoint the best judges and prosecutors in the world

We will pursue strong enforcement of federal laws.

The gangs and cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our people will be stripped apart one by one

Their day is over.

On trade, we are going to renegotiate NAFTA, withdraw from the TPP, stand up to China on our terrible trade agreement, and protect every last American job.

Hillary Clinton has supported all of the major trade deals that have stripped this country of its jobs and its wealth.

On taxes, we are going to massively cut tax rates for workers and small businesses ‚Äì creating millions of new good paying jobs.

We are going to get rid of regulations that send jobs overseas and we are going to make it easier for young Americans to get the credit they need to start a small business and pursue their dreams.

On education, we are going to give students choice, and allow charter schools to thrive

We are going to end tenure policies that reward bad teachers and hurt good ones

My opponent wants to deny students choice and opportunity, all to get a little bit more money from the education bureaucracy

She doesn‚Äôt care how many young dreams are dashed in the process.

We are going to work closely with African-American parents and students in the inner cities ‚Äì and what a big difference that will make

This means a lot to me, and it is going to be a top priority in a Trump Administration.

On healthcare, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare

Countless Americans have been forced into part-time jobs, premiums are about to jump by double-digits yet again, and just this week Aetna announced it is pulling out of the exchanges in North Carolina

We are going to replace this disaster with reforms that give you choice and freedom and control in healthcare ‚Äì at a much lower cost.

On political corruption, we are going to restore honor to our government.

In my Administration, I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information

No one will be above the law.

I am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve.

I am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office, or from any entity tied to a foreign government.

Finally, we are going to bring this country together

We are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common as Americans

We are going to reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, which sees communities of color only as votes and not as human beings worthy of a better future.

If African-American voters give Donald Trump a chance by giving me their vote, the result for them will be amazing

Look at how badly things are going under decades of Democratic leadership ‚Äì look at the schools, look at the 58% of young African-Americans not working

It is time for change.

What do you have to lose by trying something new? ‚Äì I will fix it

This means so much to me, and I will work as hard as I can to bring new opportunity to places in our country which have not known opportunity in a very long time.

Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party have taken African-American votes totally for granted

Because the votes have been automatically there, there has been no reason for Democrats to produce.

It is time to break with the failures of the past, and to fight for every last American child in this country to have the better future they deserve.

In my Administration, every American will be treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally

We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American people.

This is the change I am promising all of you: an honest government, a fair economy, and a just society for each and every American.

But we can never fix our problems by relying on the same politicians who created these problems in the first place.

72% of voters say our country is on the wrong track

I am the change candidate, Hillary Clinton is the failed status quo.

It is time to vote for a New American Future.

Together, We Will Make America Strong Again.

We Will Make American Proud Again.

We Will Make America Safe Again.

Friends and fellow citizens: Come November, We Will Make America Great Again.

It‚Äôs so great to be in Ohio

I love this state ‚Äì where I once worked ‚Äì and I love the people of this state.

I have a message for all of you tonight: we are going to win Ohio, we are going to win the White House, and we are going to bring back your jobs.

We are going to negotiate fair trade deals that put American workers first.

We are going to stop the product dumping, the unfair foreign subsidies, and the currency manipulation

We are going to stop the foreign cheating.

The era of economic surrender is over.

A new era of American Greatness is beginning.

No state has been hurt worse by the Hillary Clinton trade policies than Ohio.

Hillary Clinton backed her husband‚Äôs NAFTA, she backed China‚Äôs entrance into the World Trade Organization, she backed the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

One bad deal after another.

Hillary Clinton‚Äôs donors own her, and she will do whatever they tell her to do.

Ohio and the Akron area have lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA.

This region and this state have lost nearly 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China entered the World Trade Organization.

Our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars

This subtracts directly from our growth ‚Äì our economy grew only 1.2 percent in the last quarter, a total disaster.

This is the legacy of Obama-Clinton.

I am promising a new legacy for America.

We are going to create a New American Future.

But to do that, we have to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

Our trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost the state of Ohio more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs last year

Imagine how many more jobs would be lost if TPP was actually approved.

Hillary Clinton, who called the TPP the ‚ÄúGold Standard‚Äù, would 100% approve it if she ever got in

Her closest friend, Terry McAuliffe, confirmed that she would.

We won‚Äôt let that happen.

We will win this election, and we will keep America out of the TPP.

We will defend our freedom, our jobs, and our economic independence.

It‚Äôs going to be America First.

My economic plan is going to grow this economy, raise your wages, and create millions of new jobs.

Here are a few of the things we will do:

A massive tax cut for working Americans, and a 15% tax rate for small businesses.

We are going to eliminate regulations that kill American jobs, and that includes getting rid of the Obama Administration‚Äôs new anti-energy rules that will raise Ohio energy bills by more than 40 percent.

These Obama-Clinton energy restrictions are a tax on the poor, and they devastate low-income African-American and Latino workers.

Ohio gets 60% of its electricity from coal-powered energy.

Hillary Clinton says she wants to ‚Äúput a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.‚Äù Just like she wants to put the steel workers out of business.

We are going to put the miners and the steel workers back to work ‚Äì and we are going to get your energy bills down.

We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare, saving another 2 million jobs over the next decade.

Another major part of our agenda is law and order

More than 2,600 have been shot in Chicago alone since the beginning of this year.

This is one of the biggest differences between me and my opponent

I believe that safety is a right that belongs to all Americans.

Let me take this opportunity to thank the law enforcement officers here in this city, and across this country, for their service and sacrifice in difficult times.

Working with communities and police, I pledge to bring safety to communities across this land ‚Äì but especially to those places that have not known safety in a very, very long time.

I want every parent and child in this society ‚Äì including every African-American and Hispanic citizen ‚Äì to be able to live in a safe, thriving and prosperous community.

This is the New American Future that we are working together to create.

Hillary Clinton is the past.

We are the future.

Another major part of our agenda is immigration security

We need to protect American jobs

We need to protect American safety.

Low-income workers are hurt the most by my opponent‚Äôs policies

Poor Hispanic and African-American citizens are the first to lose a job, or see a pay cut, when we don‚Äôt control our borders.

According to Pew Research, immigration over the next fifty years will add another 100 million to our population

It will be much, much more than even that under Hillary Clinton‚Äôs radical plans

That‚Äôs unfair to the low-income workers ‚Äì African-American, Latino, all Americans ‚Äì living here today and trying to get ahead.

Hillary Clinton has forgotten the first rule of public service

The job of an elected official is to serve the citizens of the United States

If you don‚Äôt understand that, then you cannot run for President.

If you are not prepared to put American workers first, then you should not hold or seek public office.

It‚Äôs just that simple.

No issue better illustrates how corrupt my opponent is than her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State.

As the evidence has become public over the last several months, I have become increasingly shocked by the vast scope of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs criminality.

Hillary Clinton said she turned over all of her work related emails

She testified that to Congress under penalty of perjury

Now we learn about another 15,000 emails she failed to turn over have just been discovered.

Colin Powell just proved again how dishonest Hillary Clinton is after he busted her for trying to pin her email scandal on him ‚Äì one more Hillary Clinton lie.

Her Foundation took in large payments from major corporations and wealthy individuals, foreign and domestic, all while she was Secretary of State.

The Clinton Foundation accepted as much as $60 million dollars from Middle Eastern countries that oppress women, gays and people of different faiths.

The Foundation donors included corporations and individuals with significant matters before the State Department

And then either Hillary Clinton herself or one of her closest aides took action favorable to the donor.

Her actions corrupted and disgraced one of the most important Departments of government, indeed one of only four established by the United States Constitution itself.

The Clintons‚Äô made the State Department into the same kind of Pay-to-Play operations as the Arkansas Government was: pay the Clinton Foundation huge sums of money and throw in some big speaking fees for Bill Clinton and you got to play with the State Department.

The amounts involved, the favors done and the significant numbers of times it was done require an expedited investigation by a Special Prosecutor

After the FBI and Department of Justice whitewash of the Clinton email crimes, they certainly cannot be trusted to quickly or impartially investigate Hillary Clinton‚Äôs crimes.

Some former prosecutors have even suggested that the coordination between the pay-for-play State Department and the corrupt Clinton Foundation constitute a clear example of a RICO (Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization) enterprise.

The Justice Department is required to appoint an independent Special Prosecutor because it has proven itself to be a political arm of the White House.

The DOJ has acted very unethically, particularly the Attorney General‚Äôs private lengthy meeting with Bill Clinton shortly before the Department‚Äôs decision not to prosecute her for crimes that would have been prosecuted against almost any other citizen.

If the Justice Department fails to do so, it will make it even clearer that a second of the four primary constitutional Departments have been corrupted.

Here is one example of Clinton Corruption.

As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton signed off on a deal allowing Russians to take an increased stake in a company called Uranium One, giving up control of about 20 percent of America‚Äôs uranium supply to the Russians

Clinton‚Äôs approval of the deal netted the owners of the uranium company millions of dollars

In exchange for signing off on the deal, some of the former owners of Uranium One gave the Clinton Foundation millions of dollars in donations

In addition, Bill Clinton received $500,000 for a speech to a Kremlin-backed investment firm that was a beneficiary of the deal.

Here is another example of pay-for-play.

In 2009, Ericsson telecommunications came under U.S

pressure for selling telecom equipment to several oppressive governments ‚Äì including Sudan, Syria, and Iran

Some these regimes used those technologies to monitor and control their own people.

In June 2011, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs State Department began adding goods and services to a list that might be covered under expanded sanctions on Iran and other state sponsors of terrorism.

During that time, Ericsson sponsored a speech by Bill Clinton, paying him $750,000 ‚Äì his highest paying speech.

In April 2012, the Obama Administration issued an executive order imposing sanctions on telecom sales to Iran and Syria ‚Äìbut those sanctions did not cover Ericsson‚Äôs work in Iran.

A Trump Administration will end the government corruption.

No one will be above the law.

We will have one set of rules for everyone

In Hillary Clinton‚Äôs world, we have one set of rules for her ‚Äì and another set of rules for everyone else.

I am fighting for everyone who doesn‚Äôt have a voice

The forgotten men and women of America.

I am your voice.

Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign is funded by Wall Street and hedge fund managers.

My campaign is powered by my own money, but also by small dollar donations from working people across this country who want their country back.

Nothing terrifies the ruling class more than when everyday working people give 5, 10, or 15 dollars to our campaign to help us take government away from the special interests and give it back to the voters.

Come November 8th, we are once again going to have a government that serves you, your family, and your country.

We are going to rebuild our depleted military, avoid needless foreign wars, build new friendships overseas, and remember those three famous words: Peace Through Strength.

We are going to work with our allies to crush, defeat, and utterly destroy ISIS.

We are going to have a new immigration screening test to keep people out of our country who don‚Äôt support our tolerant values.

We are also going to reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, who sees people of color only as votes and not as human beings worthy of a better future.

The Democratic Party has run nearly every inner city for half a century or more

They have produced only more poverty, failing schools, and broken homes.

In the last eight years, the African-American labor force participation has declined another 3 percentage points ‚Äì and it‚Äôs dropped another 6 percent for teenagers

Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty

African-American home ownership has declined nearly ten percentage points.

Meanwhile, since 2009, another 2 million Latinos have fallen into poverty

Incomes for Latino workers fell by almost another $1,000 dollars.

Meanwhile, homicides are up nearly 50 percent in Washington D.C

and more than 60 percent in Baltimore

The level of crime in these cities is something no American should consider acceptable

Our government has failed these residents.

For those hurting the most ‚Äì who have been failed again and again by their politicians ‚Äì I‚Äôve asked in recent days, what do you have to lose by trying something new? If you keep voting for the same failed politicians you will keep getting the same results

But, most importantly, I want to talk about what you have to gain

Those hurting in our county have so much to gain by joining our campaign for a new, and more inclusive, American Future.

My tax reforms will add millions of new jobs and thousands of new small businesses.

My energy reforms will create millions of new jobs and lower the price of your energy bill.

My trade reforms will raise wages, grow jobs and add trillions in new wealth into our country.

My immigration reforms will protect your jobs and stop businesses from exploiting visa programs that hurt poor workers.

My infrastructure plans will rebuild your roads, bridges and airports.

My regulatory reforms will make it easier for African-Americans small businesses to thrive, and for young children to live out their dreams.

My promise of school choice, charter schools and merit-pay for teachers will help low-income students in our inner cities

Hillary Clinton discriminates against poor African-American children by opposing school choice.

My government reforms will make your voice heard ‚Äì not the voice of the special interests.

Every insider, getting rich off of our broken system, is throwing money at Hillary Clinton.

It‚Äôs the powerful protecting the powerful.

Insiders fighting for insiders.

I am fighting for you.

Every day you turn on the nightly news, you hear about how some self-interested banker or some Washington insider says they oppose our campaign

Or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign

Or some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign.

I wear their opposition as a badge of honor

Because it means I am fighting for REAL change, not just partisan change

I am fighting ‚Äì all of us across the country are fighting ‚Äì for peaceful regime change in our own country

The media-donor-political complex that‚Äôs bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.

I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally

We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future of security, prosperity and opportunity ‚Äì a future built on our common culture and values as one American people.

I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House.

To every parent who dreams for their children, and to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I‚Äôm with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.

Together, We Will Make America Strong Again.

We Will Make American Safe Again.

And We Will Make America Great Again.

Thank you, and God Bless

 Thank you

 It‚Äôs great to be back in North Carolina.

In 62 days, we are going to win this state ‚Äì and we are going to win the White House.

This is our chance to end years of injustice, corruption and betrayal.

This is our chance to solve all of the problems that have gone unsolved for so many years.

For how long have people been saying Washington is broken and controlled by special interests?

This is the year we can finally fix it.

That‚Äôs because change has to come from outside of our broken and corrupt system.

We will never fix our rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place.

We will never solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created our problems.

So to every American who has been waiting for real change, your wait is over ‚Äì your moment of liberation is at hand

A vote for Trump is a vote to restore Democracy, to heal our economy, and to bring millions of jobs back into every forgotten stretch of this country.

The change will begin my first day in office.

First, we are going to eliminate every unconstitutional executive order and restore the rule of law to our land.

Then, we are going to begin implementing plans for construction of a wall along our southern border

This will keep out the violent cartels and gangs, as well as their drugs that are poisoning our youth.

But that‚Äôs just the beginning.

I am going to instruct the Department of State to immediately suspend the Syrian refugee resettlement program and develop plans for the construction of a safe zone in the region

My opponent wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees

She is running to be America‚Äôs Angela Merkel.

I am also going to notify all countries that refuse to take back dangerous illegal immigrants who have committed crimes in this country that they will lose access to our visa programs if they continue to do so

This is the measure that is called for under current law, and I will enforce it

The Secretary of State is required to take this action, but Hillary Clinton refused to do so ‚Äì resulting in thousands of criminal aliens being released into U.S

communities.

Furthermore, I will direct every agency in government to begin identifying all wasteful job-killing regulations and they are going to be removed ‚Äì this will include lifting the restrictions on American energy.

I will also notify our NAFTA partners of my intention to renegotiate the deal, and will withdraw from the TPP before it can be ratified

We are going to bring these jobs back to North Carolina.

Hillary Clinton supported NAFTA, she supported China‚Äôs entry into the World Trade Organization, and she supported the TPP

She just does whatever her donors tell her to do.

In a Trump Administration, we will negotiate trade deals on behalf of American workers ‚Äì not on behalf of global corporations.

We will work to ensure farmers in North Carolina have the tools they need to thrive at home and compete on a level playing field in foreign markets ‚Äì and that means negotiating fair trade deals that put America First.

Crucially, I am also going to convene my top generals and give them a simple instruction: they will have 30 days to submit to the Oval Office a plan for defeating ISIS

Any nation who shares in this goal will be our friend in this mission.

For years, we have been caught up in endless wars and conflicts under the leadership of failed politicians and a failed foreign policy establishment in Washington D.C

The same people who made every wrong decision in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Egypt, China and Russia are the same people who are advising Hillary Clinton.

I am proud instead to have the support of our war fighting generals, active duty military officers, and top military experts who know how to win ‚Äì and know how to keep us out of endless war

Today, 88 retired U.S

generals and admirals signed a letter of endorsement.

That‚Äôs one of the biggest differences between me and Hillary Clinton

She favors what has been called military adventurism ‚Äì rushing to invade countries, displacing millions of families, then inviting the refugees into our country ‚Äì creating power vacuums filled by terrorist groups like ISIS.

I believe in a foreign policy based on our national interests that focuses on American security and regional stability ‚Äì instead of using our military to create Democracies in countries with no Democratic history.

We will work to form partnerships overseas based on a long-term strategy of defeating Radical Islamic Terrorism.

We will first have to reverse the damage inflicted by Hillary Clinton ‚Äì her legacy of failure in the Middle East, Russia and Asia has made Americans less safe than ever before.

As part of our plan to avoid and prevent foreign conflicts, we are going to rebuild our depleted military

This is the ultimate deterrent.

We will be guided by those three famous words: Peace Through Strength.

I will ask Congress to eliminate the defense sequester and immediately re-invest in our military

Right now, we have the smallest air force since 1947, the smallest army since 1939, and one of the smallest Navy‚Äôs since 1917.

Like the Cold War, we also need to fight this battle by collecting intelligence and then protecting our classified secrets

Hillary Clinton has taught us all how much of a problem we have with cyber-security.

We can‚Äôt have someone in the Oval Office who doesn‚Äôt understand the meaning of the word confidential.

The new revelations about Hillary Clinton from the just-released FBI documents make more clear than ever that she fails to meet the minimum standard for running for public office

If she applied for a low-level job at the State Department today she couldn‚Äôt even get a security clearance.

Her conduct is disqualifying

Let‚Äôs run through what we discovered in those FBI documents

It‚Äôs important, and we‚Äôre hoping Matt Lauer will ask about it on Wednesday night at the Townhall.

It‚Äôs clear from the FBI report that Hillary Clinton lied about her handling of confidential information

She repeatedly told the country that she understood the classified system, then she told the FBI she didn‚Äôt understand that the letter ‚ÄúC‚Äù meant confidential in the documents she emailed.

On 39 separate occasions she said she couldn‚Äôt recall details about her mishandling of classified information, and she couldn‚Äôt even name one step she took to make sure foreign hackers couldn‚Äôt get into her server

Keep in mind, that her insecure emails included emails about the drone program.

It‚Äôs also clear from the FBI report that Hillary Clinton and her top aides knowingly destroyed evidence and covered-up their actions

After her private server was revealed last March, her staff deleted all the emails and wiped it clean using a software designed to prevent any recovery, called BleachBit.

They used hammers to destroy phones so they couldn‚Äôt be turned over later ‚Äì and by the way, who uses 12 different phones in 4 years? The only people who use that many phones are usually involved in very, very shady activity.

People who have nothing to hide don‚Äôt smash phones with hammers

People who have nothing to hide don‚Äôt bleach their emails, or destroy evidence to keep it from being publicly archived as required under federal law.

Hillary Clinton failed to turn over thousands of documents, then tried to shield her criminal conduct by having her chief-of-staff declare herself to be Hillary Clinton‚Äôs private attorney.

Hillary and her top aides told the FBI and others in related lawsuits that they couldn‚Äôt recall or remember key facts hundreds of different times ‚Äì and that‚Äôs in addition to the guy who set up the server pleading the 5th.

No one takes all the risks Hillary Clinton took unless they are trying to cover up massive crimes.

Hillary Clinton was using the State Department to dole out special favors and access to her friends and donors.

It‚Äôs called pay-for-play.

One example of pay-for-play is what the Clinton‚Äôs did in Haiti

Let me stop here for a second and say how much we love and appreciate the Haitian-American community in Florida and across our country

We send our prayers to the many still suffering in Haiti from the earthquake.

But while Haiti has suffered, the Clintons and their pals have cashed in.

Bill and Hillary‚Äôs brothers have signed housing deals in Haiti, and one wound up on the board of a gold mining company.

Clinton Foundation donors have seen the Clintons pave the way for their investments.

In one deal, Hillary Clinton set aside environmental and labor rules to help a South Korean company with a record of violating workers‚Äô rights set up what amounts to a sweat shop in Haiti

The facility has produced only a fraction of the jobs it promised and faces reports of wage theft.

People are asking: where did all the money go?

This November, it is up to the American people to stop the Clintons from raiding America the way they have raided so many other people and places.

One of the groups in America that have been harmed the most by Hillary Clinton‚Äôs policies are African-Americans

She sees them only as votes, not as people worthy of a better future.

Many African-Americans have succeeded so greatly in this country, we will honor and protect their achievements

That includes lowering taxes for our small business owners to fifteen percent.

But millions of African-Americans in our inner cities remain trapped in poverty, joblessness and failing schools.

The Democratic Party has run the inner cities for fifty, sixty, seventy years and more.

4 in 10 African-American children in poverty, including 45% of those under the age of six.

58% of African-American youth are not working.

2,900 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.

Nationwide, African-Americans are nearly 60% of the murder victims under the age of 22.

This is a national crisis ‚Äì and anybody who fails to understand that is not fit to seek the Presidency of the United States.

To those suffering in crime and poverty, I say: give Donald J

What do you have to lose by embracing our platform of change? We are going to bring back your jobs, rebuild your cities, and give parents and students school choice

I will never, ever, ever take you for granted.

We are going to push a new Civil Rights agenda

We believe every American has the right to a safe community, a great education and government that protects their jobs.

This weekend, I had the honor to join a church service in Detroit at the Great Faith Ministries International with the amazing Bishop Wayne Jackson

It was an incredible and deeply moving experience.

I will fight for Detroit, for Chicago, for Baltimore, and for every neglected part of this nation ‚Äì and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.

Let me quote the same passage from the Bible I read on Saturday, from 1 John 4:

Imagine what we our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One Flag.

It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a New American Future.

In this future, we will respect the dignity of all Americans ‚Äì and that means great jobs, great schools, and great neighborhoods.

We will keep our children safe ‚Äì which requires secure borders, a strong military, and supporting law enforcement.

Jobs will return, prosperity will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.

Government corruption will end ‚Äì and the State Department will answer to the voters, not Hillary Clinton‚Äôs donors.

Republicans are the Party of Abraham Lincoln and, come November 8th, we will once again have a government of, by and for the people.

They‚Äôre sending people that have lots of problems, and they‚Äôre bringing those problems with us.

They‚Äôre bringing drugs. They‚Äôre bringing crime. They‚Äôre rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.

They‚Äôre bringing drugs. They‚Äôre bringing crime. They‚Äôre rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.

They‚Äôre bringing drugs. They‚Äôre bringing crime. They‚Äôre rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.

They‚Äôre bringing drugs. They‚Äôre bringing crime. They‚Äôre rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.

They‚Äôre bringing drugs. They‚Äôre bringing crime. They‚Äôre rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.

They‚Äôre bringing drugs. They‚Äôre bringing crime. They‚Äôre rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.

They‚Äôre bringing drugs. They‚Äôre bringing crime. They‚Äôre rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.

They‚Äôre bringing drugs. They‚Äôre bringing crime. They‚Äôre rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.

But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we‚Äôre getting

And it only makes common sense

It only makes common sense

They‚Äôre sending us not the right people.

It‚Äôs coming from more than Mexico

It‚Äôs coming from all over South and Latin America, and it‚Äôs coming probably‚Äî probably‚Äî from the Middle East

But we don‚Äôt know

Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening

And it‚Äôs got to stop and it‚Äôs got to stop fast.

Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East

They‚Äôve become rich

I‚Äôm in competition with them.

They just built a hotel in Syria

Can you believe this? They built a hotel

When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest

They don‚Äôt have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should‚Äôve taken.

So now ISIS has the oil, and what they don‚Äôt have, Iran has

And in 19‚Äî and I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I said‚Äî and I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that we‚Äôve ever had, and we need it more now than ever

But I said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt hit Iraq,‚Äù because you‚Äôre going to totally destabilize the Middle East

Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq

It‚Äôs great to be at Trump Tower

It‚Äôs great to be in a wonderful city, New York

And it‚Äôs an honor to have everybody here

This is beyond anybody‚Äôs expectations

There‚Äôs been no crowd like this.

And, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in

They didn‚Äôt know the air-conditioner didn‚Äôt work

They sweated like dogs.

They didn‚Äôt know the room was too big, because they didn‚Äôt have anybody there

How are they going to beat ISIS? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs gonna happen.

Our country is in serious trouble

We don‚Äôt have victories anymore

We used to have victories, but we don‚Äôt have them

When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let‚Äôs say, China in a trade deal? They kill us

I beat China all the time

All the time.

When did we beat Japan at anything? They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do? When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn‚Äôt exist, folks

They beat us all the time.

When do we beat Mexico at the border? They‚Äôre laughing at us, at our stupidity

And now they are beating us economically

They are not our friend, believe me

But they‚Äôre killing us economically.

The U.S

has become a dumping ground for everybody else‚Äôs problems.

Today I‚Äòd like to share my thoughts about the stakes in this election.

Story Continued Below

People have asked me why I am running for President.

I have built an amazing business that I love and I get to work side-by-side with my children every day.

We come to work together and turn visions into reality.

We think big, and then we make it happen.

I love what I do, and I am grateful beyond words to the nation that has allowed me to do it.

So when people ask me why I am running, I quickly answer: I am running to give back to this country which has been so good to me.

When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton ‚Äì only by me.

The fact is, we can come back bigger and better and stronger than ever before --Jobs, jobs, jobs!

Everywhere I look, I see the possibilities of what our country could be

But we can‚Äôt solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created them.

We will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first place.

The insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money.

That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre asking Bernie Sanders‚Äô voters to join our movement: so together we can fix the system for ALL Americans

Importantly, this includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals.

Because it‚Äôs not just the political system that‚Äôs rigged

It‚Äôs the whole economy.

It‚Äôs rigged by big donors who want to keep down wages.

It‚Äôs rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the U.S

with absolutely no consequences for them.

It‚Äôs rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools.

It‚Äôs rigged against you, the American people.

Hillary Clinton who, as most people know, is a world class liar ‚Äì

just look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers, a total self-serving lie.

Brian Williams‚Äô career was destroyed for saying far less.

Yesterday, she even tried to attack me and my many businesses

But here is the bottom line: I started off in Brooklyn New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business worth over 10 billion dollars

I have always had a talent for building businesses and, importantly, creating jobs

That is a talent our country desperately needs.

I am running for President to end the unfairness and to put you, the American worker, first.

We are going to put America First, and we are going to Make America Great again.

This election will decide whether we are ruled by the people, or by the politicians.

Here is my promise to the American voter:

If I am elected President, I will end the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C.

The other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests ‚Äì and taking money from special interests.

Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and theft.

She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund ‚Äì doing favors for oppressive regimes, and many others, in exchange for cash.

Then, when she left, she made $21.6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests ‚Äì in less than 2 years ‚Äì secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public.

Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001.

They totally own her, and that will never change.

The choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests, or surrendering our last scrap of independence to their total and complete control.

Those are the stakes.

Hillary Clinton wants to be President

But she doesn't have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders' said, the judgement, to be president.

She believes she is entitled to the office.

Her campaign slogan is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm with her.‚Äù

You know what my response to that is? I‚Äôm with you: the American people.

She thinks it‚Äôs all about her.

I know it‚Äôs all about you ‚Äì I know it‚Äôs all about making America Great Again for All Americans.

Our country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people first.

We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism ‚Äì focusing on what‚Äôs good for America‚Äôs middle class ‚Äì to a policy of globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy.

We reward companies for offshoring, and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed.

This is not a rising tide that lifts all boats.

This is a wave of globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs.

We need to reform our economic system so that, once again, we can all succeed together, and America can become rich again.

That‚Äôs what we mean by America First.

Our country will be better off when we start making our own products again, bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to our shores.

Our Founders understood this.

One of the first major bills signed by George Washington called for ‚Äúthe encouragement and protection of manufactur[ing]‚Äù in America.

Our first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned us by saying:

‚ÄúThe abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.‚Äù

I have visited the cities and towns across America and seen the devastation caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton.

Hillary Clinton supported Bill Clinton‚Äôs disastrous NAFTA, just like she supported China‚Äôs entrance into the World Trade Organization.

We‚Äôve lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two Hillary-backed agreements were signed.

Our trade deficit with China soared 40% during Hillary Clinton‚Äôs time as Secretary of State -- a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated, but rather scorned.

Then she let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property ‚Äì a crime which is continuing to this day.

Hillary Clinton gave China millions of our best jobs, and effectively let China completely rebuild itself.

In return, Hillary Clinton got rich!

The book Clinton Cash, by Peter Schweitzer, documents how Bill and Hillary used the State Department to enrich their family at America‚Äôs expense.

She gets rich making you poor.

Here is a quote from the book: ‚ÄúAt the center of US policy toward China was Hillary Clinton‚Ä¶at this critical time for US-china relations, Bill Clinton gave a number of speeches that were underwritten by the Chinese government and its supporters.‚Äù

These funds were paid to the Clinton bank account while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States.

She sold out our workers, and our country, for Beijing.

Hillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas ‚Äì and give up Congressional power to an international foreign commission.

Now, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she is pretending that she is against it

She has even deleted this record of total support from her book ‚Äì deletion is something she is very good at -- (at least 30,000 emails are missing.)

But this latest Clinton cover-up doesn‚Äôt change anything: if she is elected president, she will adopt the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good

She will do this, just as she has betrayed the American worker on trade at every single stage of her career ‚Äì and it will be even worse than the Clintons‚Äô NAFTA deal.

I want trade deals, but they have to be great for the United States and our workers.

We don't make great deals anymore, but we will once I become president.

It‚Äôs not just our economy that‚Äôs been corrupted, but our foreign policy too.

The Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives and trillions of dollars ‚Äì and unleashed ISIS across the world.

No Secretary of State has been more wrong, more often, and in more places than Hillary Clinton.

Her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched.

Among the victims is our late Ambassador, Chris Stevens

He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed -- that's right, when the phone rang at

3 o'clock in the morning, she was sleeping.

Ambassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds of requests for security.

Hillary Clinton‚Äôs State Department refused them all.

She started the war that put him in Libya, denied him the security he asked for, then left him there to die.

To cover her tracks, Hillary lied about a video being the cause of his death.

Here is what one of the victim‚Äôs mothers had to say:

‚ÄúI want the whole world to know it: she lied to my face, and you don‚Äôt want this person to be president.‚Äù

In 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn in, it was a different world.

Libya was cooperating.

Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence.

Syria was under control.

Iran was being choked by sanctions.

Egypt was governed by a friendly regime that honored its peace treaty with Israel.

ISIS wasn‚Äôt even on the map.

Fast forward to 2013: In just four years, Secretary Clinton managed

to almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East.

Her invasion of Libya handed the country over to the ISIS barbarians.

Thanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East, and on the road to nuclear weapons.

Hillary Clinton‚Äôs support for violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen ‚Äì while giving ISIS a launching pad for terrorism against the West.

She helped force out a friendly regime in Egypt and replace it with the radical Muslim Brotherhood

The Egyptian military has retaken control, but Clinton has opened the Pandora‚Äôs box of radical Islam.

Then, there was the disastrous strategy of announcing our departure date from Iraq, handing large parts of the country over to ISIS killers.

ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made.

ISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East, and peaceful Muslims across the world, who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality ‚Äì and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety.

In short, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another.

It all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in Iraq in the first place.

Though I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize

the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started.

But Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq, because when she got into power,

she couldn‚Äôt wait to rush us off to war in Libya.

She lacks the temperament, the judgment and the competence to lead.

In the words of a Secret Service agent posted outside the Oval Office:

‚ÄúShe simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve

in the office‚Ä¶from the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true‚Ä¶Her leadership style ‚Äì volcanic, impulsive‚Ä¶disdainful of the rules set for everyone else ‚Äì hasn‚Äôt changed a bit.‚Äù

Perhaps the most terrifying thing about Hillary Clinton‚Äôs foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by Radical Islam.

In fact, Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States, and that's an increase over President Obama's already very high number.

Under her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth ‚Äì with no way to screen who they are or what they believe.

Already, hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the U.S.

The father of the Orlando shooter was a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, one of the

most repressive anti-gay and anti-women regimes on Earth.

I only want to admit people who share our values and love our people.

Hillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved

and gays put to death.

Maybe her motivation lies among the more than 1,000 foreign donations Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department.

Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.

Here is some more of what we learned from the book,

Clinton Cash:

A foreign telecom giant faced possible State Department sanctions for providing technology to Iran, and other oppressive regimes

So what did this company do? For the first time ever, they decided to pay Bill Clinton $750,000 for a single speech

The Clintons got their cash, the telecom company escaped sanctions.

Hillary Clinton‚Äôs State Department approved the transfer of 20% of America‚Äôs uranium holdings to Russia, while 9 investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.

Hillary Clinton appointed a top donor to a national security board with top secret access ‚Äì even though he had no national security credentials.

Hillary Clinton accepted $58,000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was Secretary of State ‚Äì plus millions more for her foundation

The Sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive Sharia law, including the punishment of death by stoning for being gay

The government of Brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Hillary‚Äôs Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she would absolutely approve if given the chance.

Hillary Clinton took up to $25 million from Saudi Arabia, where being gay is also punishable by death.

Hillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and LGBT citizens.

To cover-up her corrupt dealings, Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server.

Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments ‚Äì perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China ‚Äì putting all of America in danger.

Then there are the 33,000 emails she deleted.

While we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do.

So they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be President of the United States.

This fact alone disqualifies her from the Presidency.

We can‚Äôt hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies.

National security is also immigration security ‚Äì

and Hillary wants neither.

Hillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States.

She has pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement, and thus create totally open borders in the United States

The first victims of her radical policies will be poor African-American and Hispanic workers who need jobs

They are the ones she will hurt the most.

Let me share with you a letter our campaign received from Mary Ann Mendoza.

She lost her amazing son, Police Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, after he was killed by an illegal immigrant because of the open borders policies supported by Hillary Clinton.

Sadly, the Mendoza family is just one of thousands who have suffered the same fate.

Here is an excerpt from Mrs

Mendoza‚Äôs letter:

‚ÄúHillary Clinton, who already has the blood of so many on her hands, is now announcing that she is willing to put each and every one of our lives in harms‚Äô way ‚Äì an open door policy to criminals and terrorists to enter our country

Hillary is not concerned about you or I, she is only concerned about the power the presidency would bring to her

She needs to go to prison to pay for the crimes she has already committed against this country.‚Äù

Hillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States, on top of the current record level of immigration.

For the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America.

Hillary‚Äôs Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor, and unemployed Americans out of work

She can‚Äôt claim to care about African-American and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new low-wage workers

to compete against them.

Here are a few things a Trump Administration will do for America in the first 100 days:

Appoint judges who will uphold the Constitution

Hillary Clinton‚Äôs radical judges will virtually abolish the 2nd amendment.

Change immigration rules to give unemployed Americans an opportunity to fill good-paying jobs

Stand up to countries that cheat on trade, of which there are many

Cancel rules and regulations that send jobs overseas

Lift restrictions on energy production

Repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare -- it is a disaster.

Pass massive tax reform to create millions of new jobs.

Impose tough new ethics rules to restore dignity to the Office of Secretary of State.

There is one common theme in all of these reforms.

It‚Äôs going to be America First.

This is why the stakes in November are so great.

On election day, the politicians stand trial before the people.

The voters are the jury

Their ballots are the verdict

We don‚Äôt need or want another Clinton or Obama.

Come November, the American people will have a chance to issue a verdict on the politicians that have sacrificed their security, betrayed their prosperity, and sold out

their country.

They will have a chance to vote for a new agenda with big dreams, bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the American people.

Hillary Clinton‚Äôs message is old and tired

Her message is that can‚Äôt change.

My message is that things have to change ‚Äì and this is our one chance do it

This is our last chance to do it.

Americans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system, that built the great dams, and so much more.

Then we started thinking small.

We stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions.

We lost our sense of purpose, and daring.

But that‚Äôs not who we are.

Come this November, we can bring America back ‚Äì bigger and better, and stronger than ever.

We will build the greatest infrastructure on the planet earth ‚Äì the roads and railways and airports of tomorrow.

Our military will have the best technology and finest equipment ‚Äì we will bring it back all the way.

Massive new factories will come roaring into our country ‚Äì breathing life and hope into our communities.

Inner cities, which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally be rebuilt.

Construction is what I know -- nobody knows it better.

The real wages for our workers have not been raised for 18 years -- but these wages will start going up, along with the new jobs

Hillary‚Äôs massive taxation, regulation and open borders will destroy jobs and drive down wages for everyone.

We are also going to be supporting our police and law enforcement -- we can never forget the great job they do.

I am also going to appoint great Supreme Court Justices.

Our country is going to start working again.

People are going to start working again.

Parents are going to start dreaming big for their children again ‚Äì including parents in our inner cities.

Americans are going to start believing in the future or our country.

We are going to make America rich again.  We are going to make America safe again.

We are going to make America Great Again ‚Äì and Great Again For EVERYONE.

This was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and all of the bad things and we all know what‚Äôs going on, and especially how poor she‚Äôd do as president in these very, very troubled times of radical Islamic terrorism.

Even her former Secret Service agent, who‚Äôs seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be our president

There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will deliver that speech very, very soon.

But today, there‚Äôs only one thing to discuss, the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders

The attack on the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, was the worst terror strike on our soil since September 11th, and the worst mass shooting in our country‚Äôs history.

So many people ‚Äî it‚Äôs just hard to believe, but just so many people dead, so many people gravely injured, so much carnage, such a disgrace

The horror is beyond description

The families of these wonderful people are totally devastated, and they will be forever

Likewise, our whole nation and indeed the whole world is devastated.

We express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families

We mourn as one people for our nation‚Äôs loss, and pledge our support to any and all who need it

I would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of this attack.

Thank you

Our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of Orlando‚Äôs LGBT community

They have been through something that nobody could ever experience

This is a very dark moment in America‚Äôs history

A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub, not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens, because of their sexual orientation.

It‚Äôs a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation

It‚Äôs an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want, and express their identity

It‚Äôs an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety in their own country.

We need to respond to this attack on America as one united people, with force, purpose, and determination

But the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and to think and act clearly

We‚Äôre not acting clearly, we‚Äôre not talking clearly, we‚Äôve got problems.

If we don‚Äôt get tough, and if we don‚Äôt get smart, and fast, we‚Äôre not going to have our country anymore

There will be nothing, absolutely nothing, left

The killer, whose name I will not use, or ever say, was born in Afghan, of Afghan parents, who immigrated to the United States.

His father published support for the Afghan Taliban, a regime which murders those who don‚Äôt share its radical views, and they murdered plenty

The father even said he was running for president of Afghanistan

The bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place, was because we allowed his family to come here.

That is a fact, and it‚Äôs a fact we need to talk about

We have a dysfunctional immigration system, which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens properly

We have an incompetent administration.

And if I‚Äôm elected president, that will not change, I will tell you, that will not change over the next four years

We have an administration that will not change

But if I get in there, it‚Äôs going to change, and it‚Äôs going to change quickly

We‚Äôre going from totally incompetent to just the opposite, believe me.

With 50 people dead and perhaps more ultimately and dozens more wounded, we cannot afford to talk around issues anymore

We have to address these issues head-on

I called for a ban after San Bernardino and was met with great scorn and anger but now many years and I have to say many years but many are saying that I was right to do so

And although the pause is temporary we must find out what is going on

We have to do it.

It will be lifted ‚Äî this ban ‚Äî when and as a nation we‚Äôre in a position to properly and perfectly screen these people coming into our country

They‚Äôre pouring in and we don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôre doing

The immigration laws of the United States give the president powers to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons

Now, any class ‚Äî it really is determined and to be determined by the president for the interests of the United States

And it‚Äôs as he or she deems appropriate

Hopefully it‚Äôs he in this case.

Thank you

I will use this power to protect the American people

When I‚Äôm elected I will suspend immigration from areas of the world where there‚Äôs a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats.

And by the way we have no choice

After a full and partial and long ‚Äî really long overdue security assessment we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of America

We cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer

Many of the principles of radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions.Remember this, radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti- American

I refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, Jewish people are targets of persecution and intimation by radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence

This is not just a national security issue

It‚Äôs a quality of life issue

If we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans ‚Äî women and children, gay and straight, Jews and Christians and all people then we need to tell the truth about radical Islam and we need to do it now

 We need to tell the truth also about how radical Islam is coming to our shores

 And it‚Äôs coming ‚Ä¶

With these people, folks, it‚Äôs coming

We‚Äôre importing radical Islamic terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system and through an intelligence community held back by our president

Even our own FBI director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of people we‚Äôre letting into America

All of the September 11th hijackists were issued visas

Large numbers of Somali refugees in Minnesota have tried to join ISIS.

The Boston bombers came here through political asylum

The male shooter in San Bernardino again whose name I will not mention was the child of immigrants from Pakistan and he brought his wife, the other terrorist from Saudi Arabia through another one of our easily exploited visa programs.Immigration from Afghanistan into the United States has increased nearly five fold ‚Äî five fold in just one year

According to Pew Research, 99 percent of the people in Afghanistan support oppressive sharia law

We admit many more, and that‚Äôs just the way it is

We admit many more from other countries in the region.

And I‚Äôll tell you what: They share these oppressive views and values

We want to remain a free and open society

Then, and if we do, then we have to control our borders

We have to control, and we have to control them now, not later

Right now

 Yet Hillary Clinton, for months, and despite so many attacks, repeatedly refused to even say the words radical Islam until I challenged her yesterday

 And, guess what, she will probably say them

 She sort of has said them, but let‚Äôs see what happens

She really has no choice, but she doesn‚Äôt want to.

However, she‚Äôs really been forced, and she has been forced to say these words

She supports, and the reason is, she supports so much of what is wrong, and what is wrong with this country, and what‚Äôs going wrong with our country and our borders

She has no clue, in my opinion, what radical Islam is and she won‚Äôt speak honestly about it if she does, in fact, know

She‚Äôs in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the entire world ‚Äî true weakness.

I don‚Äôt know if you know this, but just a few weeks before San Bernardino, the slaughter, that‚Äôs all it was was a slaughter, Hillary Clinton explained her refusal to say the words ‚Äúradical Islam.‚Äù Here is what she said, exact quote, ‚ÄúMuslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.‚Äù That is Hillary Clinton.

So, she says the solution is to ban guns

They tried that in France which has among the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world, and 130 people were brutally murdered by Islamic terrorists in cold blood

Her plan is to disarm law abiding Americans, abolishing the Second Amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns

No good

Not going to happen, folks

Not going to happen

Not going to happen

 Thank you.

She wants to take away American‚Äôs guns and then admit the very people who want to slaughter us

Let them come into the country, we don‚Äôt have guns

Let them come in, let them have all the fun they want.

I will be meeting with the NRA, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a presidential race, to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror

I will be always defending the Second Amendment

The bottom line is that Hillary supports policies that bring the threat of radical Islam into American and allow it to grow oversees, and it is growing

In fact, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more radical Islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our society but our entire way of life

When it comes to radical Islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss

It‚Äôs deadly ‚Äî totally deadly.

The Obama administration, with the support of Hillary Clinton and others, has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence gathering and we have, just, no intelligence gathering information

We need this information so badly, and he stopped it

We don‚Äôt have the support

We don‚Äôt have the support of the law enforcement system because Obama is not letting them do their job

They are not being allowed to do their job

And, they can do it well ‚Äî better than anybody.

We need a new leader

We need a new leader fast

They have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else

I refuse to be politically correct

I want to do the right thing

I want to straighten things out and I want to make America great again

The days of deadly ignorance will end, and they will end soon if I‚Äôm elected

As president I will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks

They don‚Äôt have those tools now

We need an intelligence gathering system second to none

Second to none

That includes better cooperation between state, local and federal officials, and with our allies, very importantly

I will have an Attorney General, a Director of National Intelligence and a Secretary of Defense who‚Äôll know how to fight a war on radical Islamic terrorism

 And they will have the support that they need to get the job done right, not like it is right now

 It‚Äôs not right

 We also must ensure the American people are provided the information they need to understand the threat

The Senate subcommittee on Immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the United States since September 11th

Nearly a year ago, the Senate Subcommittee asked President Obama‚Äôs Department of Justice, State and Homeland Security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the United States

These Departments refused to comply

Nobody even knows why

They refused to comply.

President Obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activities of any kind since September 11th

So important

The public has a right to know how these people got here, how they came on to this great land, why are they here?  We have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with or supporting radical groups and beliefs, very simple

We have to control the amount of future immigration into this country and we have to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside America

Not complicated

 Every ‚Äì and just think of this

 Take a look

 Every single event, even a single individual can be devastating, and all you have to do is take a look at what happened in Orlando and what happened in other cases

Just a single event

And just one person

Can you imagine what they‚Äôll do in large groups, which we‚Äôre allowing now to come here.

Truly our President doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs doing

He‚Äôs failed us and he‚Äôs failed us badly

Under his leadership this situation will not get any better, it will only get worse

And I‚Äôve been saying that for a long time

Each year the United States permanently admits 100,000 immigrants from the Middle East and many more from Muslim countries outside of the Middle East

Our government has been admitting ever- growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our own security.

In fact, Clinton‚Äôs State Department was in charge of admissions and the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas

Having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan including a 500 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming into our country

Tell me, tell me ‚Äì how stupid is that?

This could be a better, bigger, more horrible version than the legendary Trojan Horse ever was

Altogether, under the Clinton plan, you‚Äôd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of the children and their children

Not only their children, by the way, they‚Äôre trying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful ISIS is and how wonderful Islam is and we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening.

TRUMP: The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to really to screen

We‚Äôre not screening people.

So why don‚Äôt we have an effective screening system? We don‚Äôt

We‚Äôre being laughed at all over the world

The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian Americans

The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us how she will pay for it, her plan will cost hundreds of billions of dollars long term.

Wouldn‚Äôt this be money better spent rebuilding America for our current population including the many poor people already living here

We have cities, we have inner cities‚Ä¶

We have poverty all over and this is how we‚Äôre spending billions of dollars

We have to stop the tremendous flow of Syrian refugees into the United States

We don‚Äôt know who they are, they have no documentation and we don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre planning and we won‚Äôt unless we have proper supervisor and proper leadership in which case they‚Äôre out of here

What I want‚Ä¶ What I want is common sense

I want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes American values

That‚Äôs a choice I put before the American people

A mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit America or Hillary Clinton‚Äôs radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically correct special interests

That‚Äôs all it is

We‚Äôve got to get smart and tough and vigilant and we‚Äôve got to do it now because later is too late ‚Äî going to be too late for our country.

The media talks about home grown terrorism but Islamic radicalism and that‚Äôs a very, very important term ‚Äî a term that the president refuses to use and the networks that nurture it are imports from overseas whether you like it or whether you don‚Äôt like it

Yes, there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of poor policies of the past.

But the whole point is that we will be much, much and it will be easier to deal with our current problem if we don‚Äôt keep on bringing people who add to the problem

And that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre doing

We‚Äôre letting all of these people ‚Äî hundreds of thousands of people come in and all they‚Äôre doing is adding to this incredible problem we have.

For instance, the controversial mosque attended by the Boston bombers had at its founder and as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot

This shooter and amazingly in Orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on earth

Why would we admit people who support violent hatred?

Hillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists to our country and who suppress women, gays and anyone who doesn‚Äôt share their views or values.

She can‚Äôt have it both ways

She can‚Äôt claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to oppress these same communities

How does this kind of immigration make our lives better? How does this kind of immigration make our country better? Why does Hillary Clinton want to bring people in in vast numbers who reject our values? Why? Explain.

Ask yourself who is really the friend of women and the LGBT community, Donald Trump with actions or Hillary Clinton with her words?

hank you for the invitation to speak to you today

It‚Äôs wonderful to be in Detroit.

We now begin a great national conversation about economic renewal for America

It‚Äôs a conversation about how to Make American Great Again for everyone, and especially those who have the very least.

Detroit was once the economic envy of the world

The people of Detroit helped power America to its position of global dominance in the 20th century.

When we were governed by an America First policy, Detroit was booming

Engineers, builders, laborers, shippers and countless others went to work each day, provided for their families, and lived out the American Dream.

But for many living in this city, that dream has long ago vanished

When we abandoned the policy of America First, we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own

The skyscrapers went up in Beijing, and in many other cities around the world, while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled in Detroit

Our roads and bridges fell into disrepair, yet we found the money to resettle millions of refugees at taxpayer expense.

Today, Detroit has a per capita income of under $15,000 dollars, about half of the national average.

40 percent of the city‚Äôs residents live in poverty, over two-and-half times the national average

The unemployment rate is more than twice the national average

Half of all Detroit residents do not work.

Detroit tops the list of Most Dangerous Cities in terms of violent crime ‚Äì these are the silenced victims whose stories are never told by Hillary Clinton, but victims whose suffering is no less real or permanent.

In short, the city of Detroit is the living, breathing example of my opponent‚Äôs failed economic agenda

Every policy that has failed this city, and so many others, is a policy supported by Hillary Clinton.

She supports the high taxes and radical regulation that forced jobs out of your community‚Ä¶and the crime policies that have made you less safe‚Ä¶and the immigration policies that have strained local budgets‚Ä¶and the trade deals like NAFTA, signed by her husband, that have shipped your jobs to Mexico and other countries‚Ä¶ and she supports the education policies that deny your students choice, freedom and opportunity.

She is the candidate of the past.

Ours is the campaign of the future.

This is a city controlled by Democratic politicians at every level, and unless we change policies, we will not change results.

Today, I will outline my economic vision

In the coming weeks, we will be offering more detail on all of these policies, and the ones we have already rolled out can be viewed on my campaign website.

Our opposition, on the other hand, has long ago run out of ideas

All Hillary Clinton has to offer is more of the same: more taxes, more regulations, more bureaucrats, more restrictions on American energy and American production.

If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn‚Äôt do better than Hillary Clinton‚Äôs economic agenda.

Nothing would make our foreign adversaries happier than for our country to tax and regulate our companies and our jobs out of existence.

The one common feature of every Hillary Clinton idea is that it punishes you for working and doing business in the United States

Every policy she has tilts the playing field towards other countries at our expense.

That‚Äôs why she tries to distract us with tired political rhetoric that seeks to label us, divide us, and pull us apart.

My campaign is about reaching out to everyone as Americans, and returning to a government that puts the American people first

Here is what an America First economic plan looks like.

First, let‚Äôs talk tax reform.

Taxes are one of the biggest differences in this race.

Hillary Clinton ‚Äì who has spent her career voting for tax increases ‚Äì plans another massive job-killing $1.3 trillion-dollar tax increase.

Her plan would tax many small businesses by almost fifty percent

Recently, at a campaign event, Hillary Clinton short-circuited again ‚Äì to use a now famous term ‚Äì when she accidentally told the truth and said she wanted to raise taxes on the middle class.

I am proposing an across-the-board income tax reduction, especially for middle-income Americans

This will lead to millions of new good-paying jobs.

The rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs, or undermines our ability to compete.

As part of this reform, we will eliminate the Carried Interest Deduction and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street investors, and people like me, but unfair to American workers

Tax simplification will be a major feature of the plan.

Our current tax code is so burdensome and complex that we waste billion hours a year in tax code compliance.

My plan will reduce the current number of brackets from 7 to 3, and dramatically streamline the process

We will work with House Republicans on this plan, using the same brackets they have proposed: 12, 25 and 33 percent

For many American workers, their tax rate will be zero.

While we will develop our own set of assumptions and policies, agreeing in some areas but not in others, we will be focused on the same shared goals and guided by the same shared principles: jobs, growth and opportunity.

These reforms will offer the biggest tax revolution since the Reagan Tax Reform, which unleashed years of continued economic growth and job creation.

We will Make America Grow Again.

In the days ahead, we will provide more details on this plan and how it will help you and your family

It will present a night-and-day contrast to the job-killing, tax-raising, poverty-inducing Obama-Clinton agenda.

The State of New York has already lived through Hillary Clinton‚Äôs failed leadership

The Washington Post just published a devastating article on Hillary Clinton‚Äôs broken promises

She pledged 200,000 jobs for upstate New York as Senator

But what happened? The Washington Post writes, and I quote: ‚Äúupstate job growth stagnated overall during her tenure, with manufacturing jobs plunging nearly 25 percent‚Ä¶the former first lady was unable to pass big ticket legislation‚Ä¶ Many promised jobs never materialized and others migrated to other states as she turned to her first presidential run‚Ä¶data shows that upstate actually lost jobs during Clinton‚Äôs first term.‚Äù

Compare that to my record

In a recent New York Post article by Steve Cuozzo, ‚ÄúHow Donald Trump Helped Save New York City,‚Äù the paper writes that I ‚Äì and this is a direct quote ‚Äì ‚Äúwaded into a landscape of empty Fifth Avenue storefronts, the dust-bowl mugging ground that was Central Park and a Wall Street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out‚Ä¶almost by force of will ‚Äî [he] rode to the rescue

Expressing rare faith in the future, he was instrumental in kickstarting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up for dead.‚Äù

This is what I want to do for our country ‚Äì I want to jumpstart America

Now let‚Äôs look at what the Obama-Clinton policies have done nationally.

Their policies produced 1.2% growth, the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression, and a doubling of the national debt.

There are now 94.3 million Americans outside the labor force

It was 80.5 million when President Obama took office, an increase of nearly 14 million people.

The Obama-Clinton agenda of tax, spend and regulate has created a silent nation of jobless Americans.

Home ownership is at its lowest rate in 51 years.

Nearly 12 million have been added to the food stamp rolls since President Obama took office

Another nearly 7 million Americans were added to the ranks of those in poverty.

We have the lowest labor force participation rates in four decades.

58 percent of African-American youth are either outside the labor force or not employed.

1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force

These are the real unemployment numbers ‚Äì the five percent figure is one of the biggest hoaxes in modern politics.

Meanwhile, American households are earning more than $4,000 less today than they were sixteen years ago.

The average worker today pays 31.5 percent of their wages to income and payroll taxes

On top of that, state and local taxes consume

another 10 percent.

The United States also has the highest business tax rate among the major industrialized nations of the world, at 35 percent.

It‚Äôs almost 40 percent when you add in taxes at the state level

In other words, we punish companies for making products in America ‚Äì but let them ship products into the U.S

tax-free if they move overseas.

This is backwards

All of our policies should be geared towards keeping jobs and wealth inside the United States.

Under my plan, no American company will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes

Small businesses will benefit the most from this plan

Hillary Clinton‚Äôs plan will require small business to pay as much as three times more in taxes than what I am proposing, and her onerous regulations will put them totally out of business.

I am going to cut regulations massively.

Our lower business tax will also end job-killing corporate inversions, and cause trillions in new dollars and wealth to come pouring into our country ‚Äì and into cities like Detroit

To help unleash this new job creation, we will allow businesses to immediately expense new business investments.

No one will gain more from these proposals than low-and-middle income Americans

My plan will also help reduce the cost of childcare by allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of childcare spending from their taxes.

We are also going to bring back trillions of dollars from American businesses that is now parked overseas.

Our plan will bring that cash home, applying a 10 percent tax

This money will be re-invested in states like Michigan.

Finally, no family will have to pay the death tax

American workers have paid taxes their whole lives, and they should not be taxed again at death ‚Äì it‚Äôs just plain wrong

We will repeal it.

Next comes regulatory reform.

As with taxes, I will have one overriding goal when it comes to regulation: I want to keep jobs and wealth in America.

Motor vehicle manufacturing is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the country

The U.S

economy today is twenty-five percent smaller than it would have been without the surge of regulations since 1980.

It is estimated that current overregulation is costing our economy as much as $2 trillion dollars a year ‚Äì that‚Äôs money taken straight out of cities like yours.

The federal register is now over 80,000 pages long

As the Wall Street Journal noted, President Obama has issued close to four hundred new major regulations since taking office, each with a cost to the American economy of $100 million or more.

In 2015 alone, the Obama Administration unilaterally issued more than 2,000 new regulations ‚Äì each a hidden tax on American consumers, and a massive lead weight on the American economy

It is time to remove the anchor dragging us down

Upon taking office, I will issue a temporary moratorium on new agency regulations

My running mate, Mike Pence, signed a similar order when he became governor of Indiana

This will give our American companies the certainty they need to reinvest in our community, get cash off of the sidelines, start hiring for new jobs, and expanding businesses.

I will also immediately cancel all illegal and overreaching executive orders.

Next, I will ask each and every federal agency to prepare a list of all of the regulations they impose on Americans which are not necessary, do not improve public safety, and which needlessly kill jobs

Those regulations will be eliminated

We are in a competition with the world, and I want America to win

When I am president, we will.

One of the most important reforms of all is trade reform.

As Bernie Sanders has said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgment

We‚Äôve seen this bad judgment overseas, in Libya, Iraq, and Syria

We‚Äôve seen it in Iran

We‚Äôve seen it from President Obama, when he gives $150 billion to Iran, the number one terror state, and even gives them $400 million in money-laundered cash as a ransom payment.

But we‚Äôve also seen the terrible Obama-Clinton judgment right here in Detroit.

Hillary Clinton has supported the trade deals stripping this city, and this country, of its jobs and wealth.

She supported Bill Clinton‚Äôs NAFTA, she supported China‚Äôs entrance into the World Trade Organization, she supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and she supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

Let‚Äôs talk about South Korea for a moment, because it so perfectly illustrates the broken promises that have hurt so many American workers.

President Obama, and the usual so-called experts who‚Äôve been wrong about every trade deal for decades, predicted that the trade deal with South Korea would increase our exports to South Korea by more than $10 billion ‚Äì resulting in some 70,000 jobs.

Like Hillary Clinton‚Äôs broken promises to New York, these pledges all turned out to be false

Instead of creating 70,000 jobs, it has killed nearly 100,000, according to the Economic Policy Institute

Our exports to South Korea haven‚Äôt increased at all, but their imports to us have surged more than $15 billion ‚Äì more than doubling our trade deficit with that country.

The next betrayal will be the Trans-Pacific Partnership

Hillary Clinton‚Äôs closest friend, Terry McAuliffe, confirmed what I have said on this from the beginning: if sent to the Oval Office, Hillary Clinton will enact the TPP

Guaranteed

Her donors will make sure of it.

A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for TPP ‚Äì and it‚Äôs also a vote for NAFTA.

Our annual trade deficit in goods with Mexico has risen from close to zero in 1993 to almost $60 billion

Our total trade deficit in goods hit nearly $800 billion last year.

This is a strike at the heart of Michigan, and our nation as a whole

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, before NAFTA went into effect, there were 285,000 auto workers in Michigan

Today, that number is only 160,000.

Detroit is still waiting for Hillary Clinton‚Äôs apology

I expect Detroit will get that apology right around the same time Hillary Clinton turns over the 33,000 emails she deleted.

Hillary Clinton‚Äôs Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) will be an even bigger disaster for the auto industry

In fact, Ford Motor Company has announced its opposition to the deal.

According to the Economic Policy Institute, the U.S

trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost over 1 million manufacturing jobs in 2015.

By far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parts, which lost nearly 740,000 manufacturing jobs

Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of state workforce due to the trade deficit with TPP members.

Just imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the TPP is actually approved

That is why I have announced we will withdraw from the deal before that can ever happen

Hillary Clinton will never withdraw from the TPP

She is bought, controlled and paid-for by her donors and special interests.

Because my only interest is the American people, I have previously laid out a detailed 7-point plan for trade reform, available on my website

It includes strong protections against currency manipulation, tariffs against any countries that cheat by unfairly subsidizing their goods, and it includes a renegotiation of NAFTA

If we don‚Äôt get a better deal, we will walk away.

At the center of my plan is trade enforcement with China

This alone could return millions of jobs into our economy.

China is responsible for nearly half of our entire trade deficit

They break the rules in every way imaginable

China engages in illegal export subsidies, prohibited currency manipulation, and rampant theft of intellectual property

They also have no real environmental or labor protections, further undercutting American workers.

Just enforcing intellectual property rules alone could save millions of American jobs

According to the U.S

International Trade Commission, improved protection of America‚Äôs intellectual property in China would produce more than 2 million more jobs right here in the United States.

Add to that the saved jobs from cracking down on currency cheating and product dumping, and we will bring trillions of dollars in new wealth and wages back to the United States.

Trade has big benefits, and I am in favor of trade

But I want great trade deals for our country that create more jobs and higher wages for American workers

Isolation is not an option, only great and wellcrafted trade deals are.

Also critical to our economic renewal will be energy reform.

The Obama-Clinton Administration has blocked and destroyed millions of jobs through their anti-energy regulations, while raising the price of electricity for both families and businesses.

As a result of recent Obama EPA actions coal-fired power plants across Michigan have either shut down entirely or undergone expensive conversions

The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs.

Hillary Clinton says her plan will ‚Äúput a lot of coal companies and coal miners out of business.‚Äù We will put our coal miners and steel workers back to work.

Clinton not only embraces President Obama‚Äôs job-killing energy restrictions but wants to expand them, including going after oil and natural gas production that employs some 10 million Americans.

According to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, the Obama-Clinton energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person.

A Trump Administration will end this war on the American worker, and unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country.

According to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on all sources of American energy will:

-Increase GDP by more than $100 billion dollars annually, add over 500,000 new jobs annually, and increase annual wages by more than $30 billion dollars over the next 7 years;

-Increase federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion dollars over 4 decades;

-Increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion dollars over the next 40 years.

The reforms I have outlined today are only the beginning When we reform our tax, trade, energy and regulatory policies, we will open a new chapter in American Prosperity

We can use this new wealth to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.

As part of this new future, we will also be rolling out proposals to increase choice and reduce cost in childcare, offering much-needed relief to American families

I will unveil my plan on this in the coming weeks that I have been working on with my daughter Ivanka and an incredible team of experts.

Likewise, our education reforms will help parents send their kids to a school of their choice.

We will also give our police and law enforcement the funds and support they need to restore law and order to this country

Without security, there can be no prosperity

We must have law and order.

In the coming days, we will be rolling out plans on all of these items

One of my first acts as President will be to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare, saving another 2 million American jobs.

We will also rebuild our military, and get our allies to pay their fair share for the protection we provide ‚Äì saving us countless more billions to invest in our own country.

We also have a plan, on our website, for a complete reform of the Veterans Health Administration

This is something so desperately needed to make sure our vets are fully supported and get the care they deserve.

Detroit ‚Äì the Motor City ‚Äì will come roaring back

We will offer a new future, not the same old failed policies of the past

Our party has chosen to make new history by selecting a nominee from outside the rigged and corrupt system.

The other party has reached backwards into the past to choose a nominee from yesterday ‚Äì who offers only the rhetoric of yesterday, and the policies of yesterday

There will be no change under Hillary Clinton ‚Äì only four more years of Obama.

But we are going to look boldly into the future.

We will build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, sea ports and airports that our country deserves.

American cars will travel the roads, American planes will connect our cities, and American ships will patrol the seas

American steel will send new skyscrapers soaring.

We will put new American metal into the spine of this nation

It will be American hands that rebuild this country, and it will be American energy ‚Äì mined from American sources ‚Äì that powers this country.

It will be American workers who are hired to do the job.

Americanism, not globalism, will be our new credo.

Our country will reach amazing new heights.

All we have to do is stop relying on the tired voices of the past.

We can‚Äôt fix a rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place.

We can‚Äôt solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created them.

Only by changing to new leadership, and new solutions, will we get new results.

We need to stop believing in politicians, and start believing in America.

Before everything great that has ever happened, the doubters have always said it couldn‚Äôt be done.

America is ready to prove the doubters wrong.

They want you to think small

I am asking you to think big.

We are ready to dream great things for our country once again.

We are ready to show the world that America is Back ‚Äì Bigger, and Better and Stronger Than Ever Before

hank you

I am thrilled to be here in Iowa among so many good friends.

Story Continued Below

Iowa is fortunate to have some of the best and most dedicated public servants in the country ‚Äì including Governor Terry Branstad, Lt

Governor Kim Reynolds, State GOP Chairman Jeff Kauffman, Senator Chuck Grassley and, of course, our great host, Senator Joni Ernst.

What an incredible roster.

I also want to take a moment to thank the Bikers who have been so good to me throughout this campaign

I can‚Äôt tell you how much it means to me

They are fantastic people who truly love our country.

More than anything, today, I want to express my gratitude to our amazing Veterans

We will not let you down.

Together, we are going to win this state in November ‚Äì and we are going to win the White House for the American people.

The White House will become the People‚Äôs House

We will tackle and fix the problems that have gone unsolved for years: failing schools, crumbling infrastructure, broken borders, bloated bureaucracy, wasteful spending, and a government that just doesn‚Äôt work.

This is a campaign about big ideas designed to help everyday people

These are the people who work hard but who don‚Äôt have a voice.

It‚Äôs also a campaign about restoring honesty and accountability to government service.

The whole world has been shocked by the continuing revelations regarding Hillary Clinton and her pay-for-play State Department.

Now it was just announced that her important calendar records will not be released to the public until after the election ‚Äì more protection from a corrupt government.

As I‚Äôve said many times in recent days, it‚Äôs hard to tell where the Clinton Foundation ends, and where the State Department begins.

The Clinton Corruption scandals have been a sad time for America

The illegal server, the foreign hacking, the deleted emails, the secret schedules, the lying to Congress

It‚Äôs all just too much

How much more can voters take?

Hillary Clinton thinks she‚Äôs entitled to be President ‚Äì she thinks that she‚Äôs above the law

But the truth is the opposite: her criminal conduct at home, and her failed interventions overseas, simply make her unfit to serve in the Oval Office.

I believe America is ready to turn the page on this sordid past

We don‚Äôt want another 4 years of Obama or Clinton Controversies: they‚Äôre not only dangerous but, frankly, exhausting to the people

How do you even keep up with them all?

The Clintons have had their time on the stage‚Äì but now it‚Äôs time to close that chapter in the history book and open a new one.

That is why this is such an exciting year to be a Republican, and to vote Republican.

This year, the GOP is offering the voters a chance to break-up the corrupt establishment and to create a New American Future.

This chance will never come again.

The Big Banks and Wall Street donors who want nothing to change are throwing millions and millions at my opponent

These are the same people who paid Bill and Hillary Clinton $150 million for speeches.

Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign is all about protecting the powerful.

Our campaign is about protecting those who have no power.

Together, we are going to give working people a voice for the first time in a very, very long time.

Let‚Äôs talk about what that means.

For our Veterans, it means a guarantee that they can seek medical care at either a VA facility or at a private medical doctor.

Never again will we allow a Veteran to die waiting for the care they need

We will protect those who protect us.

At the center of our change agenda is also a plan to fix our rigged economy.

The government just revised the growth numbers for last quarter down again ‚Äì it‚Äôs now only 1.1 percent

That‚Äôs not just bad, it‚Äôs catastrophic

We‚Äôre going to Make America Grow Again.

That begins with supporting our family farms right here in Iowa.

Family farms are the backbone of this country

We are going to end the EPA intrusion into your family homes and your family farms.

We are going to protect the Renewable Fuel Standard, eliminate job-killing regulations like the Waters of the U.S

rule, and provide desperately-needed tax relief.

Almost 97% of farms in this country are family-owned and family-managed

It‚Äôs not only a great American tradition, but a vital component of America‚Äôs economic and national security.

Yet, Hillary Clinton wants to shut down family farms just like she wants to shut down the mines and the steelworkers

She will do this not only through radical regulation, but also by raising taxes on family farms ‚Äì and all businesses ‚Äì to rates as high as nearly 50 percent

Adding to the pain, she will tax family farms again at death by as much as 45 percent.

On top of that, her anti-energy agenda will drive up the cost of energy ‚Äì another attack on agriculture.

We are going to end this war on the American farmer.

That includes our plan to lower the tax rate on family farms down to 15 percent, and to stop the double-taxation of family farms at death ‚Äì helping to ensure that the family farm tradition in Iowa continues to thrive and flourish.

My economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs.

I am asking for the support of all Americans who want more opportunity, higher wages, safe communities, competent leadership, and honest government.

We are going to send the special interests packing, and we are going to once again have a government of, by, and for the people.

Republicans are the Party of Lincoln.

Which brings me to a subject that is so important and personal for me

Nothing means more to me than working to make our party the home of the African-American vote once again.

There are millions of African-Americans in this country who have succeeded so greatly and who deserve a government that protects and honors their incredible contribution.

But we also have to talk about the millions of African-Americans who remain trapped in poverty and failing schools.

I‚Äôve spoken a lot in recent days about the deplorable conditions in many of our inner cities

As a father, as a builder, as an American, it offends my sense of right and wrong to see anyone living in such conditions.

Almost 40 percent of African-American children are living in poverty ‚Äì including 45 percent of children under the age of six.

In Detroit, half of its residents do not work

In Milwaukee, almost 4 in 10 African-American men between the age of 24-54 are not employed.

More than 6,000 African-Americans are the victims of murder every year.

Just yesterday, the cousin of NBA star Dwayne Wade was the victim of a tragic shooting in Chicago

She was the mother of 4, and was killed while pushing her infant child in a stroller.

It breaks our hearts

This shouldn‚Äôt happen in America

We send our thoughts and our prayers to the family, and we also promise to fight for a better tomorrow.

Across Chicago, more than 2,700 have been shooting victims since January of this year.

We cannot, as a society, tolerate this level of violence and suffering in our own cities

Those who would deny that this is a national crisis ‚Äì a crisis requiring urgent action ‚Äì have no business running for elected office.

Failed Democratic policies ‚Äì the policies of Hillary Clinton ‚Äì have created this high crime and crushing poverty.

In so many communities under Democratic control, we have bad schools, no jobs, high crime, and no hope

It can‚Äôt get any worse

To those suffering, I say: vote for Donald Trump and I will fix it

What do you have to lose?

Let me also tell you what you have to gain: millions of jobs, better schools and safe communities.

By the way, how quickly people have forgotten that Hillary Clinton called black youth ‚Äúsuper-predators,‚Äù and how insulted they were.

I am running to offer a better future ‚Äì to the citizens of Detroit, Baltimore, Chicago, and all across this great land.

African-Americans have given so much to this country

They‚Äôve fought and died in every war since the Revolution

They‚Äôve lifted up the conscience of our nation in the Civil Rights movement

They‚Äôve sacrificed so much for the national good.

Now is the time to put a new agenda into action that expands opportunity, ensures equality, and that protects the rights of each and every citizen.

This includes one of the most important rights of all: the right to live in safety

I will work with communities, with police, and with federal law enforcement, to make communities safe and secure for all of our people.

We are also going to end the discrimination that traps parents and kids in failing government schools

The Republican Party is the Party of School Choice.

There is another civil rights issue we need to talk about, and that‚Äôs the issue of immigration enforcement.

Every time an African-American citizen, or any citizen, loses their job to an illegal immigrant, the rights of that American citizen have been violated.

Equal protection under the law must include the consistent application of our immigration laws.

These laws were passed to protect American citizens and lawful residents

For instance, federal law protects the ability of American workers to seek jobs and employment

When government suspends those immigration laws in order to curry favor with special interests ‚Äì costing Americans their jobs ‚Äì they have been denied the protection of their laws.

In recent days, the media ‚Äì as it usually does ‚Äì has missed the whole point on immigration

All the media wants to talk about is the 11 million or more people here illegally.

But my priority is the well-being of 300 million American citizens, including millions of Hispanic citizens and legal residents who want a secure border, a safe and drug-free community, and a growing economy.

My goal is to provide good jobs, good schools, and safety to every Hispanic community in the country

But we can‚Äôt do that if we don‚Äôt secure our border.

On Day One, I am going to begin swiftly removing criminal illegal immigrants from this country ‚Äì including removing the hundreds of thousands of criminal illegal immigrants that have been released into U.S

communities under the Obama-Clinton Administration.

These international gangs and cartels will be a thing of the past

Their reign of terror will be over

In this task, we will always err on the side of protecting the American people ‚Äì we will use immigration law to prevent crimes, and will not wait until some innocent American has been harmed or killed before taking action.

I am going to build a great border wall, institute nationwide e-verify, stop illegal immigrants from accessing welfare and entitlements, and develop an exit-entry tracking system to ensure those who overstay their visas are quickly removed

If we don‚Äôt enforce visa expiration dates, then we have an open border ‚Äì it‚Äôs as simple as that.

I am also going to cancel all unconstitutional executive orders and empower rank-and-file ICE officers and Border Patrol officers to finally do the jobs they were hired for.

Now, what is Hillary Clinton going to do?

She has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, combined with the elimination of virtually all routine immigration enforcement

In other words, totally open borders

Which will lead to a massive crime wave.

Most alarmingly, she has pledged to keep President Obama‚Äôs executive amnesty ‚Äì which has been blocked by the Supreme Court ‚Äì directly disregarding a Supreme Court injunction.

Beyond that, she has pledged to add another executive amnesty in violation of both Congressional law and the U.S

Constitution.

These actions from Hillary Clinton will trigger one of the greatest Constitutional crisis in American history

In effect, she is pledging to abolish the law-making powers of Congress and assume the powers of an imperial ruler.

This executive amnesty would bypass Congress to print millions of work permits and benefit cards to those ineligible to receive them.

Hillary Clinton‚Äôs immigration proposal will also give illegal immigrants access to Obamacare, Social Security, Medicare and all U.S

welfare

Her plan will functionally end enforcement of visa overstays rules, another open border decree

She will also close down detention centers for border-crossers, meaning we will have an open southern border as well.

This is not to mention that Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees

She can‚Äôt even say the words: Radical Islamic Terrorism.

And she supports the Sanctuary City and catch-and-release policies that are getting innocent Americans killed

I‚Äôve met with many of these grieving families, including the incredible family of Sarah Root, a young Iowa girl who was killed by an illegal immigrant released from the border by the Obama Administration ‚Äì and then released again after the killing

I‚Äôve been so inspired by the courage and bravery of the Root Family and I‚Äôd like to invite them on the stage right now just to say a few words.

Thank you

There is a reason why 16,500 Border Patrol agents have endorsed our campaign, and warned that Hillary Clinton‚Äôs plan is ‚Äúdeeply dangerous‚Äù ‚Äúdivisive‚Äù ‚Äúradical‚Äù ‚Äúreckless‚Äù ‚Äúwrecking innocent lives‚Äù ‚Äúpanders to extremists‚Äù and would create ‚Äúunprecedented crisis‚Äù

So the choice couldn‚Äôt be more clear

A vote for Trump is a vote to have a nation of laws, a vote for Clinton is a vote for open borders.

On every issue, our campaign is about making life better for working people

But we can‚Äôt accomplish that goal unless we break-up the special interest monopoly and give power back to the citizens.

Many people have said that establishment media assault on me and our campaign ‚Äì we have a movement ‚Äì is the greatest in the political history of our country

Even today, some major papers fail to mention how strong our poll numbers have become over the short one-week period ‚Äì they just refuse to print anything positive or good.

They too are part of the rigged system trying to deny people the positive change they deserve

They take phrases and statements, chop them up, take them out of context, and discuss them for days

Always trying to demean and belittle me and our incredible movement to take our country back from the death spiral it is currently in.

Imagine if this much media attention was spent telling the truth about the real problems facing America

Imagine if the media spent this much time telling the story of Sarah Root.

All of the ugly things being said by Hillary Clinton in recent days ‚Äì funded by big banks and Wall Street donors ‚Äì are nothing more than a desperate attempt by failed leaders to cling to power in order to keep rigging the system.

There is nothing they won‚Äôt say or do, no lie they won‚Äôt tell ‚Äì and no amount of money they won‚Äôt spend ‚Äì to try to bully voters into giving them what they want.

This November 8th, the American people are going to reject the cynicism of the past and embrace the optimism of the future.

The old attacks aren‚Äôt going to work anymore

The Clinton-Kaine fear-mongering isn‚Äôt going to resonate with anyone but the most radical factions of their far-left base.

I want to empower people

Hillary Clinton wants to scare people.

Empowering people begins with three simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs.

Our economy will soar.

Wages will rise.

We will make new friends abroad, and achieve new peace at home.

We will be a country of laws, and a country of great success.

Our cities will be safe, sound and secure.

Our government will be honest, ethical and responsive.

Rule by special interests will be over

The rule of the American people will begin.

So let‚Äôs get out and vote on November 8th, and create the future our children deserve.

Together, We Will Make America Strong Again.

We Will Make American Wealthy Again.

We Will Make America United Again.

We Will Make America Safe Again.

And We Will Make America Great Again ‚Äì For Everyone.

I am so thrilled to be in Tampa today

Florida is my second home.

This is such an amazing state, and filled with so many incredible people.

For the next 75 days, we are all going to have to work hard together to win the White House on November 8th.

Our victory on November 8th will be a victory for the people.

It won‚Äôt be a victory for the pundits, the special interests, the failed politicians

It will be a victory for YOU ‚Äì for your family, for your country.

It will be a victory for jobs

For security

For prosperity.

It will be a victory for American Independence.

We will reject the failures of the past and create a New American Future where every child ‚Äì African-American, Hispanic, and all children ‚Äì can live out their dreams.

We will bring back our jobs.

Rebuild our depleted military.

Take care of our Veterans.

Unleash American energy.

Restore law and order.

And will make government honest once again.

The stakes in this election could not be higher.

Hillary Clinton wants to raise taxes and send jobs to other countries

We are going to cut taxes dramatically, and bring thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs to our shores.

Hillary Clinton wants to pass more terrible trade deals, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership

We are going to stop the TPP, renegotiate NAFTA, and protect every last American job.

Hillary Clinton wants to expand the job-killing regulations destroying small business in America

We are going to cancel every needless job-killing regulation, and put a moratorium on new regulations until our economy gets back on its feet

We will create great numbers of American jobs.

Hillary Clinton wants to put the miners and the steel workers out of work

We are going to lift restrictions on all American energy, and we are going to stand up to foreign cheating that threatens steel production in America.

Hillary Clinton wants to expand job-killing Obamacare and put government in charge of healthcare

We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare, and create choice and competition that puts patients first.

Hillary Clinton wants to trap children in failing schools

I want school choice, charter schools, and merit-pay for teachers

We are going to put our kids on the ladder of success: a good education, and a good-paying job.

This is so important in our inner cities

Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children are in poverty

58% of African-American youth are not employed

More than 2,700 have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of this year

Violent crime is up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C

and more than 60% in Baltimore.

The Democratic Party has run nearly every inner city in this country for fifty or sixty years or more

They‚Äôve produced only more poverty, crime, joblessness and broken homes.

To those suffering and hurting and left behind, I say: Vote for Donald J

Trump

What do you have to lose by trying something new? Let me also tell you what you have to gain: more jobs, more security, higher wages, and a prosperous community.

I am asking for the honor of your vote so I can fight for you.

Hispanic citizens have been suffering under this President too.

Since President Obama came into office, another 2 million Latinos have joined the ranks of those in poverty

Incomes for Latino households have declined by nearly $1,000 under President Obama

The number of Latino children living in poverty increased by 15 percent.

I am going to fight to give every Hispanic citizen in this country a better future.

Part of that better future means securing our border to protect the jobs of all people living here today ‚ÄìAfrican-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, all Americans.

Hillary Clinton wants a totally open border

We are going to enforce our laws, remove people who overstay their visas, dismantle the gangs and cartels, and protect jobs and benefits for hardworking American citizens.

That includes protecting the jobs and wages of Hispanic citizens living right here in Florida

They deserve to have their jobs protected from illegal immigration and broken visa programs.

All Americans ‚Äì from all backgrounds ‚Äì have a right to have their jobs protected in their own country.

Hillary Clinton would rather give a job to an illegal immigrant than to an unemployed Hispanic citizen ‚Äì or to a Veteran.

It‚Äôs going to be America First from now on.

At the core of our America First agenda are three words: jobs, jobs, jobs.

That‚Äôs why, at the center of my economic plan, is a tax cut for small businesses ‚Äì down to fifteen percent from 35 percent

Jobs will pour into our country, and new ones will be created across the nation.

There are over 600,000 Hispanic-owned businesses here in Florida

Hillary Clinton‚Äôs plan would smother them with regulations, drive up their electricity bills, and then raise their taxes to as much as almost fifty percent

Family-owned businesses would take a second hit with a 45 percent death tax ‚Äì killing more jobs and more community businesses here in Florida.

A Trump Administration will be a true friend to small businesses and working Americans

That means bringing down taxes, bringing down the price of energy, and bringing down job-killing regulations that cost our economy as much as $2 trillion a year.

We are also going to dramatically simplify our tax code

Our current tax code is so burdensome and complex that we waste 9 billion hours a year in tax code compliance.

That will end under a Trump Administration.

Hillary Clinton wants to make taxes even more complicated, and will raise taxes $1.3 trillion dollars.

Her anti-energy regulations, will be a tax hike on the poor.

According to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, the Obama-Clinton energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person.

Right now as a country we have no growth.

A Trump Administration will end this war on the American worker, and unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country.

It is so great to be back in New Hampshire

I have developed such deep affection for this state and for its people

My first victory took place here.

Over the next 74 days, we are all going to work very hard together to win this state ‚Äì just like we did in the primaries ‚Äì and to win the White House for the American people.

Our victory is going to be a victory for the great majority of Americans whose voice has not been heard.

Year after year, we live under a Washington regime that ignores your demands, rejects your cries for help, and that always puts your needs last.

The real divide in this election is not between left and right, but between everyday working people and a corrupt political establishment that works only for itself.

This election is a chance for the great majority of decent citizens to end the rule of a small group of special interests and to return that power to the voters.

Hillary Clinton believes only in government of, by and for the powerful.

I am promising government of, by and for the people.

In this fight, we are taking on some very entrenched and well-financed interests

These are the same people who pay Hillary $10,000 dollars a minute for a speech

These special interests are the same people who own the newspapers that cover-up her crimes

These are the Wall Street firms who paid Hillary Clinton a quarter of a million dollars each time she delivered her secret remarks

They are the same people who paid Bill and Hillary Clinton over $150 million dollars for speeches since Bill left the Oval Office ‚Äì and who donated countless millions more to the Clinton Foundation.

But, you have the power, with your vote, to defeat those special interests and put the people back in charge once more.

This has been a historic week in American politics.

The voters have always known that our leadership in Washington D.C

is corrupt, and that the system is very badly rigged.

But this week the curtain was lifted

The corruption was revealed for all to see

The veil was pulled back on a vast criminal enterprise run out of the State Department by Hillary Clinton.

As the Associated Press documented, more than half of the meetings Hillary Clinton took as Secretary of State with people outside government were Foundation donors.

Hillary Clinton‚Äôs chief of staff received more messages from the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs Chief Operating Officer than just about anyone else.

85 donors alone that she met with as Secretary gave the Foundation $156 million dollars.

On top of that, Bill Clinton‚Äôs total speaking fees rose 44% while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State ‚Äì often raking in money from people who had business or matters before the State Department.

As I said weeks ago, Hillary Clinton ran the State Department like a personal hedge fund.

It is hard to tell where the Clinton Foundation ended, and where the State Department began.

Access and favors were sold for cash

It‚Äôs called Pay-For-Play.

Over and over and over, people who donated to the Clinton Foundation ‚Äì or who gave money to Bill Clinton ‚Äì got favorable treatment from Hillary Clinton‚Äôs State Department.

The examples are too many to name here in full, and I‚Äôve gone over some in recent days

They include the deal to sell 20% of U.S

Uranium to Russia, or the favorable treatment for UBS

It includes the exemption of Telecom Giant Ericsson from government sanctions

It includes efforts to put a Foundation donor ‚Äì with no national security experience ‚Äì onto a highly-sensitive national security panel with access to top secret information

It includes Foundation donors getting lucrative contracts in Haiti ‚Äì all while the people of Haiti suffered horribly.

But these examples are only the tip of the Clinton Corruption iceberg.

Hillary Clinton‚Äôs actions constitute all of the elements of a major criminal enterprise.

She created a private illegal email server in order to hide her corrupt dealings

She did so knowing full well it would put American lives at risk by making classified information highly vulnerable to foreign hacking

But, she didn‚Äôt care ‚Äì as long as it helped her get away with her crime, no risk to America was too great.

Then, to further cover-up her crime, she deleted 33,000 emails to keep them out of the hands of authorities and the American public.

As a further element of the criminal cover-up, she claimed under penalty of perjury that she turned over all of her work related emails

We now know this to be one more massive Clinton lie

The FBI found thousands of work-related emails she failed to turn over, including the new discovery this week of 15,000 more work-related emails she failed to disclose.

What is being uncovered now is one of the most shocking scandals in American political history.

A Secretary of State sold her office to corporations and foreign governments, betraying the public trust ‚Äì putting innocent lives in danger ‚Äì and then she went to great lengths to hide, delete, destroy and lie about the evidence

Just like her lie that she never sent any material marked classified.

Lie after lie after lie.

This is the corruption we expect to see in a Third World country ‚Äì but not in America.

Just imagine the damage to our security, to our integrity, to our standing in the world, if Hillary Clinton is allowed to sell the Oval Office the same way she sold her office as Secretary of State.

We cannot let this happen.

We must vote on November 8th to keep the American government from being sold to the highest bidder.

Vote to save your country

Vote to protect your family

Vote for honesty, integrity and accountability.

Now, as all of these revelations have been discovered this week, Hillary Clinton has been in hiding.

But today, she emerges

However, she is emerging not to take responsibility for her unethical and criminal conduct, but instead to make one of the most brazen attempts at distraction in the history of politics.

Now, I have not seen Hillary Clinton‚Äôs remarks

And, in a sense, I don‚Äôt want to dignify them by dwelling on them too much, but a response is required for the sake of all decent voters she is trying to smear.

The news reports are that Hillary Clinton is going to try to accuse this campaign, and the millions of decent Americans who support this campaign, of being racists.

It‚Äôs the oldest play in the Democratic playbook.

When Democratic policies fail, they are left with only this one tired argument

It‚Äôs the last refuge of the discredited politician.

They keep going back to this same well, but the well has run dry.

This is the year that the people who have been betrayed by Democratic policies, including millions of African-American and Hispanic-American citizens, reject the politicians who have failed them and vote for change.

As I‚Äôve discussed for many days now, Democratic politicians have run nearly every inner city in America for fifty or sixty years or more

Their policies have produced only more poverty, joblessness, and failing schools.

Every policy Hillary Clinton supports is a policy that has failed and betrayed communities of color in this country

But she just doesn‚Äôt care ‚Äì she‚Äôs too busy raking in cash from the people rigging the system.

Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty

58% of African-American youth are not working

More than 2,700 people have been shot in Chicago this year alone.

These are the consequences of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs policies

She has brought nothing but pain and heartache to our inner cities.

On top of that, she wants to raise taxes on African-American owned businesses to as much as nearly 50 percent

We should be helping these businesses to grow and expand ‚Äì but Hillary Clinton is trying to shut them down.

She opposes school choice.

She supports open borders that violate the civil rights of African-Americans by giving their jobs to people here unlawfully.

She supports trade policies that have closed factories in African-American communities and put millions of African-Americans out of work.

She supports radical regulations that put Americans out of work and raise the price of their energy bills.

She supports policies on crime that make communities less safe, and that make it harder to raise your children in security and peace.

I believe every single parent in this country ‚Äì and especially in the inner cities ‚Äì has the right to raise their kids in safety

This is one of the great civil rights issues of our time.

But Hillary Clinton doesn‚Äôt want to talk about any of this

She can‚Äôt defend her record

She doesn‚Äôt have one single proposal that hasn‚Äôt been tried and failed

She doesn‚Äôt have one idea that does anything but destroy jobs for African-American and Hispanic citizens ‚Äì and all citizens ‚Äì in our country.

So what does she do when she can‚Äôt defend her record?

She lies, she smears, she paints decent Americans as racists

She bullies voters, who only want a better future, and tries to intimidate them out of voting for change.

As I discussed yesterday, these are the same tactics the establishment powers used to try to scare the British people out of voting for change too.

It didn‚Äôt work there

It won‚Äôt work here.

The American people are ready to vote for freedom, opportunity and justice

They are ready to take back control of their own futures.

It‚Äôs time the Clintons were held accountable for their inappropriate conduct

According to the book Game Change, Bill Clinton said about President Barack Obama that ‚Äúa few years ago this guy would have been getting us coffee.‚Äù 

And we‚Äôve all seen the cringe-worthy comments from Hillary Clinton, which I won‚Äôt get into here but we all know what they are.

Here‚Äôs the important point though that I want to get across today

Hillary Clinton isn‚Äôt just attacking me, she‚Äôs attacking all the people who support our movement.

We can‚Äôt let that stand

Voters are used to the old game where failed politicians like Hillary Clinton falsely smear Republicans with charges of racism

Republicans then back down

Democrats then continue to push policies that are devastating to communities of color.

We must break this corrupt cycle

And we are going to break it beginning today.

So let me make some very clear statements before this whole country.

First, on the border

People who want their laws enforced and respected, and who want their border secured, are not racists

They are patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs protected and their country kept safe

I will never apologize for pledging to enforce and uphold every single law of the United States, and to make my immigration priority defending and protecting American citizens above every other single consideration

We will end illegal immigration and we will restore the Constitutional rule of law.

Next, on national security

People who speak out against Radical Islam, and who warn about refugees, are not Islamophobes

They are decent American citizens who want to uphold our values as a tolerant society, and who want to keep the terrorists out of our country

If the choice is between saving lives ‚Äì or appeasing politically-correct censors in Washington D.C., that is the easiest choice I will ever have to make

I will always choose saving American lives.

Now, on crime

People who support the police, and who want crime reduced, are not prejudiced

They are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost to preventable violence

There is no compassion in tolerating crime, and poisonous drug dealing, and the killings in our streets

I will work to dismantle the criminal gangs and cartels and to liberate our poorest citizens from crime and violence and poverty and fear.

To Hillary Clinton, and to her donors and advisors, pushing her to spread her smears and her lies about decent people, I have three words

I want you to hear these words, and remember these words: Shame On You.

When you are like the Clintons, getting $69 million dollars in political contributions from Wall Street and Big Banks, it is easy to look down on the so-called little people

It‚Äôs easy to ignore the devastation caused by our open borders when you spend all your time with wealthy donors and Hollywood celebrities

It is easy to ignore the heartfelt concerns of communities about Radical Islam entering our country, when you spend your time hanging out with foreign dictators in their lavish palaces

And it is easy, no doubt, for Hillary Clinton to turn a blind eye to the ravages of crime, when she has her own personal armed security force.

This is how the system is rigged.

For decades, the American people have demanded that their immigration laws be enforced and that their jobs be protected from out-of-control immigration

But the special interests, who only want cheap labor, have stopped it from happening.

For years, the American people have worried about letting Radical Islam spread within our shores, but the elites ‚Äì who only want to raise more money from global corporations ‚Äì ignore the concerns of the American voters.

For fifty years, people living in our inner cities have suffered under a failed policy regime

But the Democratic politicians ‚Äì who only want to please media executives and Wall Street donors ‚Äì do nothing but expand the hurt and the suffering.

It is time for a new day to dawn in America.

On November 8th, we will end the rule of special interests ‚Äì and we will begin the rule of the people.

I am asking for your vote so that we can break free from the failures of the past and create a New American Future.

I am asking for your vote so that we can achieve amazing things for the American people.

I am asking for the vote of every African-American, and Hispanic-American, who wants a better future ‚Äì a future that begins with jobs, jobs and more jobs.

We will fix our disastrous trade deals and stand up to countries that cheat.

We will lower taxes and create millions of new jobs as a result.

We will unleash an American energy revolution.

We will eliminate job-killing regulations.

We will repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare.

We will enforce our immigration laws, and we will put rules in place that hire American workers first.

We will end the era of nation-building, and instead work in partnership with our allies to crush and destroy ISIS.

We will keep Radical Islamic Terrorism out of our country.

We will promote the values of tolerance, justice and acceptance.

We will steadfastly reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms.

America will be one nation ‚Äì united in common purpose and common dreams

Our citizens will proudly promote our values and our system of government as the best in the world ‚Äì and we will do so without apology.

Together, We Will Make America Prosperous Again.

We Will Make America Proud Again.

We Will Make America Safe Again.

Friends, citizens and fellow Americans: We Will Make America Great Again.

Thank you, and God Bless!

Thank you

I am so thrilled to be back in Washington.

Together, we are going to work hard over the next 70 days and we are going to win this state ‚Äì and we are going to win the White House.

It‚Äôs going to be a victory for the people

A victory for the everyday citizen whose voice hasn‚Äôt been heard.

It will be a win for the voters ‚Äì not the pundits, not the journalists, not the lobbyists, not the global special interests funding my opponent‚Äôs campaign.

This is going to be YOUR victory

We are going to create the New American Future our children deserve.

In this new future, millions of workers on the sidelines will be returned to the workforce.

Crumbling roads, bridges and airports will be replaced with the infrastructure our country needs and deserves.

Families trapped in welfare will be provided with jobs and opportunity.

Government will become lean, effective, responsible ‚Äì and honest.

Our border will be protected, and our children will be safe.

We will rebuild our inner cities, and provide safety and peace to all of our citizens.

American values and culture will be cherished and celebrated once again.

But to achieve this future, we must break free from the bitter failures of the past ‚Äì and reject the same insiders telling us the same old lies.

One area where honesty is badly needed is on the subject of economic and living conditions for African-American citizens in the United States.

Millions of African-Americans in this country have succeeded greatly, and their contributions to every area of our life ‚Äì now and throughout our history ‚Äì should be celebrated and cherished

This includes the amazing achievements in art, science, sport, music, medicine, business and so much else

This includes millions of African-American entrepreneurs, innovators and the millions of African-American workers in our middle class.

But we must also talk about those who have been left behind, the millions suffering in disastrous conditions in so many of our inner cities ‚Äì and neighborhoods afflicted by poverty, drugs, and violence.

No group in America has been more harmed by Hillary Clinton‚Äôs policies than African-Americans.

There is no better evidence of this fact than Hillary Clinton‚Äôs immigration policy, which brings in illegal immigrants and refugees to take jobs from hardworking African-American and Hispanic citizens.

Instead of providing free healthcare and jobs to millions of refugees from around the world, we should rebuild our inner cities and provide jobs to struggling Americans.

Tonight, I am asking for the vote of every African-American and Hispanic citizen in this country who wants a better future.

The inner cities of our country have been run by the Democratic Party for fifty, sixty, seventy years.

These Democratic policies ‚Äì the policies of Hillary Clinton ‚Äì have produced only poverty, joblessness, failing schools, broken homes, and rising crime.

Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of children under the age of six

58% of African-American youth are not working

Meanwhile, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty since 2009.

In Detroit, half of all its residents do not work

In Milwaukee, almost 4 in 10 African-American men between the ages of 24-54 do not have a job.

Here, in the state of Washington, 65% of Latino children and 60% of African-American children live in low-income households.

Chicago just had the most violent month in 20 years

More than 2,800 have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.

It breaks our hearts.

We cannot let this violence continue

It must be ended.

Under A Trump Administration, it will be ended.

It will be my priority to work with communities, local police, state police and federal law enforcement to dismantle the gangs and to liberate our citizens from violence and poverty and fear

I will appoint the best judges and prosecutors and federal investigators who will make this their personal mission.

There is one thing which can no longer be denied: if you keep voting for the same people, you will keep getting the same results

To those suffering, I say: what do you have to lose by voting for Donald Trump? I will fix it

I will fight for you as no one ever has before.

Let me also tell you what you have to gain: jobs, opportunity, security, and safety.

This means so much to me.

I believe every child in this country ‚Äì in Detroit, in Baltimore, in Chicago ‚Äì has the right to live out their lives in safety and peace.

In the Wall Street Journal, Heather Mac Donald of the Manhattan Institute just wrote an important article about the soaring crime in our inner cities, and the responsibility of Democratic politicians for creating this problem.

The article is called: ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter to Donald Trump.‚Äù McDonald writes that ‚ÄúMr

Trump‚Äôs call to restore law and order recognizes the right of inner-city residents to enjoy the same freedom from fear that the rest of America now takes for granted.‚Äù

Freedom from violence is one of the great civil rights issues of our time

So too is the issue of school choice.

We will fight for the right of parents to send their kids to the school that they believe gives their kids the best shot at success.

I will not accept a future in which children of any color in this country are not fully included in the American Dream

Our whole country loses when we leave millions of talented, aspiring Americans on the sidelines

We want to give everyone a chance to contribute their full talents to our economy and our country.

Remember: the Republican Party is the Party of Lincoln, the party of freedom, equality and opportunity

It is the Democratic Party that is the party of slavery, the party of Jim Crow, the party of oppression.

Nothing makes me more honored and proud than to be the nominee of Abraham Lincoln‚Äôs Republican Party.

Our party will fight to bring hope to every forgotten stretch of this country.

Once again, we will be One American Nation.

One United People.

And we will have One Great Future.

That great future will be built on these three critical words: jobs, jobs, jobs.

This will include a complete revitalization of our manufacturing sector, which has been so badly hurt by Hillary Clinton‚Äôs policies.

We are bringing the jobs back to our country.

We are going to renegotiate NAFTA, keep out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, stand up to China, and fight for every last American job.

The destruction that NAFTA started will be finished off if the Trans-Pacific Partnership is approved.

That would be a disaster

We won‚Äôt let it happen.

But that‚Äôs just the beginning of what we are going to do for American workers.

On taxes, we are going to provide massive tax relief to all working people, and lower the tax rate on small business from 35% down to 15%

Low and middle-income parents will also be able to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes.

On regulations, I am going to direct every agency and Department Head in my government to identify all needless and job-killing regulations and they will be removed

We will have a temporary moratorium on new regulations to allow our economy to grow and thrive.

Economic growth for last quarter has been revised down to 1.1%, a total disaster

Meanwhile, our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars.

We will further bring back our jobs by unleashing an American energy revolution ‚Äì lifting restrictions on oil, coal, natural gas and all sources of American energy

This will create millions of jobs and lower the price of energy for all families.

We are also going to secure our border to stop the drugs from pouring in

The Seattle-area recently experienced the largest number of heroin-related deaths in 20 years

We have to stop the drugs poisoning our communities.

Another major issue in this race is foreign policy

Hillary Clinton has made one bad foreign policy decision after another ‚Äì beginning with her support for going to war in Iraq in the first place, which I opposed.

Her tenure as Secretary of State may be regarded as the most disastrous in U.S

history.

Look at the world before and after she became Secretary of State.

Pre-Hillary, in early 2009, Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence.

Libya was stable.

Syria was under control.

The group we know today as ISIS was close to being extinguished.

Iran was being choked by sanctions.

Now, fast-forward to present time.

After Hillary, here is what the world looks like:

Iraq is in total chaos.

Syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war and a refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States.

ISIS has been unleashed onto the entire world.

Iran ‚Äì the world‚Äôs top state sponsor of terrorism ‚Äì has been put on the path to nuclear weapons, and was given a $400 million dollar cash ransom payment.

This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction and terrorism.

America deserves a better legacy.

All of you deserve a better future

I am the change agent.

Hillary Clinton is the defender of the status quo.

While our country lost badly under Hillary Clinton, she cashed in big time

Bill Clinton‚Äôs speaking fees surged while Hillary was Secretary of State ‚Äì Bill was paid almost $50 million dollars for speeches during her tenure, an increase of 44% over the previous 4 years.

Then there was all the money funneled into the Clinton Foundation from foreign governments and corporations.

It was pay-for-play

Just look at what she did with UBS, or the Russian Uranium, or disaster relief in Haiti, and so many other examples.

But the only way to learn the full depth of her public corruption is to read the 33,000 emails she deleted.

Hillary Clinton said under oath that she turned over all of her work-related emails

But we know that is one more Clinton lie

The FBI found thousands of work-related emails she never turned over, and then another 15,000 emails were just discovered a few weeks ago.

Now, today, another 30 emails were discovered by the State Department that Hillary Clinton failed to turn over ‚Äì these were emails about Benghazi.

It just never ends with the Clintons.

There is only one way to get justice in this rigged system and that is to show up and vote on November 8th ‚Äì and to vote big.

In A Trump Administration, the State Department will work for the country ‚Äì not for Hillary Clinton‚Äôs donors.

Under Hillary Clinton, it‚Äôs the powerful protecting the powerful.

Politicians defending politicians.

Insiders fighting for insiders

 I am fighting for you.

The government will work for citizens once again.

The era of division will be replaced with a future of unity.

We are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common

We will proudly promote our culture as Americans, the best in the world.

It is time to break with the failures of the past, and to fight for every last child in this country to have the better future they deserve.

This is the change I am promising all of you: an honest government, a thriving economy, and a just society for each and every American.

I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House.

Together, We Will Make America Wealthy Again.

We Will Make America Strong Again.

We Will Make America Proud Again.

We Will Make America Safe Again.

And We Will Make America Great Again.

Wow

Thank you very much

Hello

I‚Äôd like to begin by thanking the people of Montana, South Dakota, New Mexico, New Jersey and California

We had some big, big days and we have some big numbers coming in, very big numbers.

I‚Äôm truly honored by your support

Together, we accomplished what nobody thought was absolutely possible and you know what that is and we‚Äôre only getting started and it‚Äôs going to be beautiful, remember that.

Tonight we close one chapter in history and we begin another

Our campaign received more primary votes than any GOP campaign in history, no matter who it is, no matter who they are, we received more votes

This is a great feeling

That‚Äôs a great feeling.

This is not a testament to me but a testament to all of the people who believed real change, not Obama change, but real change is possible

You‚Äôve given me the honor to lead the Republican Party to victory this fall

We‚Äôre going to do it

We‚Äôre going to do it, folks

We‚Äôre going to do it.

I understand the responsibility of carrying the mantle and I will never, ever let you down ‚Äì too much work, too many people, blood, sweat and tears

I‚Äôm never going to let you down

I will make you proud of your party and our movement, and that‚Äôs what it is, is a movement.

Now recent polls have shown that I‚Äôm beating Hillary Clinton and with all of her many problems and the tremendous mistakes that she‚Äôs made and she has tremendous mistakes, we expect our lead to continue to grow and grow substantially

To everyone who voted for me throughout this campaign, I want to thank you

I want to thank you very, very much.

To those who voted for someone else in either party, I will work hard to earn your support and I will work very hard to earn that support

To all of those Bernie Sanders voters who have been left out in the cold by a rigged system of super delegates, we welcome you with open arms

And by the way, the terrible trade deals that Bernie was so vehemently against and he‚Äôs right on that will be taken care of far better than anyone ever thought possible and that‚Äôs what I do

We are going to have fantastic trade deals

We‚Äôre going to start making money and bringing in jobs.

Now I know some people say I‚Äôm too much of a fighter

My preference is always peace, however and I‚Äôve shown that

I‚Äôve shown that for a long time

I built an extraordinary business on relationships and deals that benefit all parties involved, always

My goal is always again to bring people together

But if I‚Äôm forced to fight for something I really care about, I will never, ever back down and our country will never, ever back down.

Thank you

I‚Äôve fought for my family

I‚Äôve fought for my business

I‚Äôve fought for my employees

And now, I‚Äôm going to fight for you, the American people like nobody has ever fought before

And I‚Äôm not a politician fighting, I‚Äôm me

You‚Äôre going to see some real good things happen.

Just remember this: I‚Äôm going to be your champion

I‚Äôm going to be America‚Äôs champion because you see this election isn‚Äôt about Republican or Democrat; it‚Äôs about who runs this country ‚Äì the special interests or the people and I mean the American people.

Every election year politicians promise change

Obama promised change and it didn‚Äôt work out too well

And every year they fail to deliver

Why would politicians want to change a system that‚Äôs totally rigged in order to keep them in power? That‚Äôs what they‚Äôre doing, folks

Why would politicians want to change a system that‚Äôs made them and their friends very, very wealthy? I beat a rigged system by winning with overwhelming support, the only way you could‚Äôve done it ‚Äì landslides all over the country with every demographic on track to win; 37 primary caucus victories in a field that began with 17 very talented people.

After years of disappointment, there is one thing we all have learned ‚Äì we can‚Äôt fix the rigged system by relying on very, and I mean this so, so strongly, on the very people who rigged it, and they rigged it, and do not ever think anything differently

We can‚Äôt solve our problems by counting on the politicians who created our problems.

The Clintons have turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves

They‚Äôve made hundreds of millions of dollars selling access, selling favors, selling government contracts, and I mean hundreds of millions of dollars

Secretary Clinton even did all of the work on a totally illegal private server

Something about how she‚Äôs getting away with this folks nobody understands.

Designed to keep her corrupt dealings out of the public record, putting the security of the entire country at risk and a President in a corrupt system is totally protecting her ‚Äì not right

I am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week and we‚Äôre going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons

I think you‚Äôre going to find it very informative and very, very interesting

I wonder if the press will want to attend, who knows.

Hillary Clinton turned the State Department into her private hedge fund ‚Äì the Russians, the Saudis, the Chinese ‚Äì all gave money to Bill and Hillary and got favorable treatment in return

It‚Äôs a sad day in America when foreign governments with deep pockets have more influence in our own country than our great citizens.

I didn‚Äôt need to do this

It‚Äôs not easy, believe me

I didn‚Äôt need to do it

But I felt I had to give back to our wonderful country which has been so good to me and to my family

I‚Äôve traveled to many of our states and seen the suffering in people‚Äôs eyes

I‚Äôve visited communities in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Indiana and Ohio whose manufacturing jobs, they literally, these jobs have virtually disappeared, an embarrassment to our country and it‚Äôs horrible

I‚Äôve embraced the victims of illegal immigration, moms and dads who have had to bury their own children because of people that shouldn‚Äôt have been in the country ‚Äì remember it, folks, remember it.

I visited the crumbling cities and the struggling schools

I‚Äôve seen our dilapidated airports, highways, bridges and I‚Äôve compared them to other countries where we see facilities so far superior to ours it‚Äôs really not to be believed, hard to imagine what‚Äôs happened to our country

America is getting taken apart piece by piece, auctioned off, and just rapidly, auctioned off to the highest bidder

We‚Äôre broke, we‚Äôre broke

We owe $19 trillion dollars going quickly to $21 trillion

Our infrastructure is a disaster

Our schools are failing

Crime is rising

People are scared

The last thing we need is Hillary Clinton in the White House or an extension of the Obama disaster.

What a crowd, what a crowd

Thank you all very much

We love our country, we love our country

But we can turn this all around

We‚Äôre going to do it by putting America first

That commitment is the foundation for change that‚Äôs been missing and it‚Äôs been missing for a long time

It‚Äôs important to understand what America First means

It means on foreign policy we will never enter into any kind conflict unless it makes us safer as a nation

It has to make us safer as a nation

This is the opposite of Hillary‚Äôs foreign policy which invaded Libya, destabilized Iraq, unleashed ISIS and threw Syria into chaos and created the mass migration which is wreaking havoc all over the world, and while putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons and making them a dominant power in the Middle East and they are dominant and we have made them that way, folks

We have made them that way.

You better hope I‚Äôm President

On trade, America First means the American worker will have his or her job protected from unfair foreign competition

What‚Äôs happening there is absolutely a disgrace

No PPP, you‚Äôre right about that and you mean no PP

We are going, and remember this; we are only going to have great trade deals, OK

We are only going to have that

We‚Äôre not going to approve, as somebody just said, the TransPacific Partnership which is a disaster, a disaster, for our country, almost as bad as NAFTA signed by Bill Clinton, which has just stripped our country of our factories and our manufacturing and moved them to other places, in particular Mexico

If it‚Äôs not a great deal for our country, we will not sign it

It‚Äôs got to be great for our country, for our community, for everybody in here because believe me we are all suffering and we‚Äôre suffering bigly and it‚Äôs getting worse.

On energy policy, America First means opening up America‚Äôs great potential to bring wealth and prosperity to our own workers including our wonderful and hard-working miners who have been absolutely totally mistreated by this Administration.

On economic policy, America First means having tax and regulatory policies that keep jobs and wealth in the United States, substantially lowering taxes for middle class Americans and business; likewise, regulation which is strangling our economy which would be brought down from its present insane level

We will make it very, very good for our companies, for our small business and for people that want to survive and do well in our country.

On immigration policy, America First means protecting the jobs, wages and security of American workers, whether first or tenth generation

No matter who you are, we‚Äôre going to protect your job because let me tell you our jobs are being stripped from our country like we‚Äôre babies

The beauty of America First is that it brings us all together

Every American worker of every background is entitled to the same benefits, protections and rights and privileges; it‚Äôs got to be that way

We are going to build a 350 ship Navy, a 540,000 soldier Army, an Air Force of 1,200 combat-ready fighter jets, and a Marine Core built on 36 Battalions. Crucially, we are also going to pursue a state-of-the-art missile defense.

We will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the Ballistic Missile Defense capability our nation needs.

As we expand our Navy toward the goal of 350 ships, we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming years.

Just today we were reminded of the need for missile defense after North Korea performed its fourth nuclear test since Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State.

One more massive Hillary Clinton failure.

Just like she failed in Iran and put them on the path to nuclear weapons.

Hillary Clinton has presided over the greatest series of foreign policy failures and blunders anyone has ever seen. Her policies have produced massive global disorder.

She handed Iraq over to ISIS, unleashing that terror group onto the world. ISIS would not be threatening the West today if not for the decisions Hillary Clinton made.

She helped destabilize Egypt by supporting the ouster of President Mubarak in exchange for the Muslim Brotherhood. Fortunately, President El-Sisi is now in charge, but terrorists have gained a foothold in that country.

She helped push Syria into a prolonged civil war by pushing regime change in that country too ‚Äì without any plan for the day after.

She failed with China, which has only grown more aggressive. By the way, she also let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property.

And of course, Hillary Clinton failed with her Russian Reset. She gave up missile defense in Poland and the Czech Republic in exchange for nothing in return. Then, she gave up 20% of U.S. uranium to Russia ‚Äìwhile those who benefited from the deal gave money to the Clintons.

Let‚Äôs not forget, Russia went into Crimea on President Obama‚Äôs watch.

Unlike Clinton and Obama, we will negotiate with Russia from a position of strength ‚Äì not weakness. And weakness is all we get from President Obama and Hillary Clinton.

The difference between me and my opponent on Vladimir Putin, and in all negotiations, is that I negotiate by creating leverage so I can extract a good deal for the United States.

Hillary Clinton negotiates but never gets anything of value for the United States. Putin laughs at our leaders, and takes them to the cleaners again and again.

That is why we will rebuild our military, strengthen our economy, and regain our position of leadership in the world ‚Äì so we can negotiate from a position of great strength once again.

If I cannot get a good deal for the United States, I will follow the example of Ronald Reagan and walk away. That is completely contrary to the way President Obama and Hillary Clinton negotiate which gets nothing of value for the United States, ever. They just keep losing.

I will end this legacy of failure and strongly defend the interests of the United States.

But I will also keep focused on the ultimate goal. We will not seek endless conflict and hostility; we won‚Äôt get trapped in the failed approaches of the past. A future where America can find common ground with countries like Russia and China is a better future for our children.

We will pursue these relationships with our eyes wide open, and a clear understanding of our many, many differences. I will advocate the American position with a strength and clarity President Obama and Hillary Clinton never have. No more apology tours. No more bowing to foreign powers. We proudly defend America at every single turn.

America will get the respect it deserves.
